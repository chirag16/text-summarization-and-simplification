# text-summarization-and-simplification
This repository contains the code for our final project for CS 685, Spring 2022. 

We employ two approaches to solve this task:

1. Pipeline Approach: Using Pre-trained PEGASUS-arXiv and MUSS (BART + ACCESS) models
2. Finetuning Long-Former Approach: By Finetune the Longformer model on the EurekaAlert dataset
