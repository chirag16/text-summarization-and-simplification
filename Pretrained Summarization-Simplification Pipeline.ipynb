between the anthelminthic drug , helminths and microbiome composition might occur . to dissect this , we analyse the changes that take place in the gut bacteria profiles in samples from a double blind placebo controlled trial conducted in an area endemic for soil transmitted helminths in indonesia . either placebo or albendazole were given every three months for a period of one and a half years . helminth infection was assessed before and at 3 months after the last treatment round . in 150 subjects , the bacteria were profiled using the 454 pyrosequencing . statistical analysis was performed cross-sectionally at pre-treatment to assess the effect of infection , and at post-treatment to determine the effect of infection and treatment on microbiome composition using the dirichlet-multinomial regression model . at a phylum level , at pre-treatment , no difference was seen in microbiome composition in terms of relative abundance between helminth-infected and uninfected subjects and at post-treatment , no differences were found in microbiome composition between albendazole and placebo group . however , in subjects who remained infected , there was a significant difference in the microbiome composition of those who had received albendazole and placebo . this difference was largely attributed to alteration of bacteroidetes . albendazole was more effective against ascaris lumbricoides and hookworms but not against trichuris trichiura , thus in those who remained infected after receiving albendazole , the helminth composition was dominated by t. trichiura . we found that overall , albendazole does not affect the microbiome composition . however , there is an interaction between treatment and helminths as in subjects who received albendazole and remained infected there was a significant alteration in bacteroidetes . this helminth-albendazole interaction needs to be studied further to fully grasp the complexity of the effect of deworming on the microbiome . isrctn registy , isrctn83830814 . studying the relationship between soil-transmitted helminthiasis and gut microbiota is becoming more important as both have been implicated in modulating immune system in various inflammatory diseases . however , findings of previous studies of the effect of helminth on the microbiome are inconsistent . in this study , an optimal design , a placebo-controlled anthelminthic trial was conducted to dissect the effect of helminths and anthelminthic treatment on gut microbial profile . in addition , a novel statistical model was used to analyse the association by taking into account the correlation structures between bacterial categories by applying multivariate analysis whereby the multiple testing correction is not needed . shortly after birth , the human body is colonized by a community of bacteria [ 1 , 2 ] with relatively simple composition which increase in number and complexity with age [ 3 ] . the densest colonization with commensal microbes of the human body is found in the intestine [ 4 ] which has a beneficial impact on gastro-intestinal function and host health by providing support for host metabolism , protection against pathogenic microbes , integrity of intestinal mucosa , and modulation of the immune system [ 2 , 3 , 5 ] . furthermore , it has been shown that intestinal microbiota is associated with dietary habits [ 6 , 7 ] , physiological factors such as age , gender and bmi [ 8 , 9 ] as well as diseases , such as inflammatory bowel disease and obesity [ 1 , 5 , 10 ] . ethics_statement this study was nested within the immunospin study , a double blind placebo-controlled trial conducted in flores island , indonesia [ 24 ] . the immunospin study has been approved by the ethical committee of faculty of medicine , universitas indonesia , ref:194/pt02.fk/etik/2006 and has been filed by ethics committee of the leiden university medical center . the clinical trial was registered with number : isrctn83830814 in which the protocol for the trial and supporting consort checklist are available elsewhere [ 27 ] . the subjects gave their informed consent either by written signature or thumb print . parental consent was obtained for children below 15 years old . genomic dna samples were isolated from 100 mg of fresh stool , which were also used for detection of helminth infection by real time pcr . the dna amplification and pyrosequencing followed the protocols developed by the human microbiome project ( hmp ) [ 29 ] at the mcdonnell genome institute , washington university school of medicine in st. louis . briefly , the v1-v3 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified by pcr and the pcr products were purified and sequenced on the genome sequencer titanium flx ( roche diagnostics , indianapolis , indiana ) , generating on average 6,000 reads per sample . the filtering and analytical processing of 16s rrna data for this cohort has been previously described in details [ 30 ] . the assembled contigs count data as a result of rdp classification was organized in matrix format with taxa in columns and subjects in row . the entries in the table represent the number of reads for each phyla for each subject . rarefaction to 2000 reads was performed using an r package ( vegan ) [ 31 ] . we obtained the count data of 609 bacterial genera and 18 bacteria phyla . in the analysis at phylum level , we retained the 5 most prevalent phyla ( actinobacteria , bacteroidetes , firmicutes , proteobacteria , and unclassified bacteria ) and pooled the remaining phyla into a pooled category such that there are only 6 phyla categories . the unclassified bacteria represents the category where all the the within sample diversity ( shannon and richness diversity ) indices as well as the between sample diversity ( bray-curtis distance ) were computed at baseline and follow-up using the dataset at genera level . clustering of samples and bacteria was studied by plotting a heat map of bacteria genera which were present in at least one sample and which had an average relative abundance of more than 1 % . this cutoff was chosen to exclude rare genera . unless stated otherwise , the rest of the analyses were done at the phylum level . a pearsons chi-squared test statistic was used to test for differences of infection prevalence between the two treatment groups at pre and at post-treatment . characteristics_of_the_study_subjects at baseline , 94 out of 150 ( 62.7 % ) individuals were infected with one or more helminth species , and hookworm was the most dominant species ( 52.1 % ) followed by t. trichiura ( 44.7 % ) and a. lumbricoides ( 37.2 % ) . the baseline characteristics such as age , gender , and helminth prevalence were similar between the two treatment arms although the prevalence of n. americanus was slightly higher in albendazole group , but not statistically significant ( table 1 ) . the additional relevant characteristics of the participants are listed in s2 table . with regard to the microbiome composition , the proportions of each bacterial phyla were also similar between two treatment arms with the highest abundance at the phylum level being firmicutes followed by actinobacteria , proteobacteria and bacteroidetes . using bacterial data at the genus level ( a total of 609 genera ) , we calculated the within sample diversity ( richness and shannon index ) and between sample diversity ( bray-curtis dissimilarity ) . we observed a similar within-sample diversity at pre and post-treatment as evident from the shannon diversity index ( 2.99 vs 2.96 ) and the richness index ( 66.17 vs 62.16 ) . the bray-curtis dissimilarity measures the percentage of similarities between two samples in a community and the values range from 0 ( completely similar ) to 1 ( completely dissimilar ) . as reported earlier [ 30 ] , the bray-curtis dissimilarities calculated from 150 subjects at pre-treatment was 0.61 and the same average was obtained when calculating the bray-curtis dissimilarities at post-treatment , indicating that in average there was 61 % dissimilatory percentages between each pairs of samples . when stratifying all samples based on infection status at pre-treatment and on randomization arm at post-treatment , again we observed similar beta-diversities , indicating that neither infection nor treatment induced a shift in diversity . when analyzing the genera in relation to infection status rather than treatment , the average shannon diversity index as well as the average richness was similar between the infected and the uninfected group at pre-treatment and post-treatment ( s1 fig ) . using the dirichlet-multinomial regression model , we observed that there was no difference on the microbiome composition at the phylum level when subjects with any helminth infection were compared with uninfected ones either at pre ( fig 4a ) or at post treatment ( fig 4b ) time points . the same was the case when infection with a specific helminth species was considered ( fig 4a and 4b ) . in the dirichletmultinomial regression analysis carried out at the phylum level , bacteroidetes was the phyla that showed significant differences in subjects who remained infected in the albendazole arm compared to those who remained infected in the placebo arm . we dissected this further to assess which bacteroidetes genera accounted for this difference using the dirichlet-multinomial regression model on 6 bacterial categories which were obtained as follows . the phylum bacteroidetes was divided into three categories , namely the bacteroides , prevotella and pooled bacteroidetes . the first two genera were chosen as they were the two most abundant in the phylum bacteroidetes . in the analyses , as 6 categories are needed , we included another three phyla , i.e. , actinobacteria , firmicutes and pooled remaining phyla ( pooled phyla ) . as for the modelling at the phylum level , firmicutes was used as a reference . similar to the analyses at the phylum level , we characterized the association of infection and treatment on these 6 bacterial categories that comprised the genera belonging to bacteroidetes . there are two unique aspects to the current study on the effect of helminths on the gut microbiome in subjects living in rural areas of indonesia , namely the combination of the study design and the statistical approach . the statistical parametric or nonparametric approaches are typically used to test the hypothesis whether the microbiome compositions are significantly different between groups [ 2023 ] . while the nonparametric approach suffers from lack of statistical power when the sample size is small [ 39 ] , available parametric approaches consider the abundance of each bacterial categories separately , hence requiring multiple testing corrections . the previous studies in zimbabwe , malaysia and ecuador relating microbiome and helminths compared the difference of abundance of certain bacteria category between groups by using the standard or paired t-test and addressed multiple testing by bonferonni corrections or false discovery rate [ 2022 ] . the clustering of bacteria has been investigated before using descriptive nonparametric approaches such as pca or nmds . when we applied these method to our genera data , no clustering was observed ; neither by infection status nor by randomization arm . this might be an indication that pca or nmds were unable to capture the correlation between genera . we further analysed the multivariate data composed of 6 phyla ( firmicutes , actinobacteria , bacteroidetes , proteobacteria , unclassified bacteria and pooled category ) simultaneously in relation to helminth infection status and treatment using a parametric approach . this multivariate approach takes into account the nature the 16s rdna assembled sequences , annotation and abundances from all the

increase hiv testing . the purpose of this study was to use a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial ( rct ) to evaluate the effect of a crowdsourced hiv intervention on hiv testing uptake among men who have sex with men ( msm ) in eight chinese cities . an hiv testing intervention was developed through a national image contest , a regional strategy designathon , and local message

using a closed cohort stepped wedge cluster rct in eight chinese cities ( guangzhou , shenzhen , zhuhai , and jiangmen in guangdong province ; jinan , qingdao , yantai , and jining in shandong province ) from august 2016 to august 2017 . msm were recruited through blued , a social networking mobile application for msm , from july 29 to august 21 of 2016 . the primary outcome was self-reported hiv testing in the past 3 months . secondary outcomes included hiv self-testing , facility-based hiv testing , condom use , and syphilis testing . generalized linear mixed models ( glmms ) were used to analyze primary and secondary outcomes . we enrolled a total of 1,381 msm . most were 30 years old ( 82 % ) , unmarried ( 86 % ) , and had a college degree or higher ( 65 % ) . the proportion of individuals receiving an hiv test during the intervention periods within a city was 8.9 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] 2.215.5 ) greater than during the control periods . in addition , the intention-to-treat analysis showed a higher probability of receiving an hiv test during the intervention periods as compared in this setting , crowdsourcing was effective for developing and strengthening community-based hiv testing services for msm . crowdsourced interventions may be an important tool for the scale-up of hiv testing services among msm in low- and middle-income countries ( lmic ) . clinicaltrials.gov nct02796963 why_was_this_study_done ? approximately 14 million people living with hiv have yet to be tested , compromising the effectiveness of hiv treatment and prevention programs [ 1 ] . testing rates are particularly poor among key populations ( e.g. , men who have sex with men [ msm ] , 25 % 32 % ) in low- and middle-income countries ( lmic ) [ 1,2 ] . entrenched community norms that marginalize key populations , limited hiv resources , and insufficient community awareness all contribute to low levels of hiv testing around the world , including china [ 35 ] . summary the study protocol provides a more detailed description of the trial design and analysis plan ( s1 text ) [ 19 ] . briefly , we developed an intervention consisting of a multimedia hiv testing campaign , an online hiv testing service , and local testing promotion campaigns tailored for msm . the intervention was developed using crowdsourcing and consisted of three components : a nationwide open contest call for images and concepts that encourage hiv testing , a 72-hour regional designathon for developing hiv testing strategies [ 20 ] , and local participatory contests soliciting hiv testing messages . we then conducted a closed cohort stepped wedge cluster rct in eight chinese cities to evaluate the impact of this crowdsourced intervention compared to conventional programs routinely provided by local centers for disease control ( cdcs ) and community-based organizations ( cbos ) . the intervention was implemented over 12 months . we followed standard guidelines for reporting stepped wedge cluster rcts ( s1 consort checklist ) [ 21 ] . the steps for intervention development are shown in fig 1 and further explained in s2 text . three participatory activities shaped the content and structure of the intervention : a nationwide open contest , a regional strategy designathon , and local participatory contests . we selected four cities each from guangdong province ( guangzhou , shenzhen , zhuhai , and jiangmen ) and shandong province ( jinan , qingdao , yantai , and jining ) . each city had existing infrastructure for msm hiv surveillance led by the local cdc and capacity to deliver new hiv testing services . participants were eligible if they were born biologically male , age 16 or older , currently living and planning to live in one of the eight cities for 12 months post-enrollment , hiv-negative or unknown hiv status , had not had hiv testing within the past 3 months , had anal sex with a man at least once during their lifetime , and were willing to provide their cell phone numbers for follow-up . we recruited participants through chinas largest msm social networking mobile phone application ( app ) , blued , by sending a survey invitation to registered users in the eight selected cities . after electronically signing an informed consent form , all participants were asked to fill out a survey at baseline , and at every 3 months thereafter . any participant who returned a photo of a positive test result was counseled to seek out confirmatory testing from their local cdc or cbo and was no longer eligible for subsequent follow-up surveys . conditions of the control state , intervention , and post-intervention period are shown in fig 3 . to determine the necessary sample size for recruitment , we assumed that a crowdsourced intervention would be more effective than a conventional method for promoting hiv testing [ 14 ] . we assumed an hiv testing rate of 25 % during the control period and 35 % during the intervention period . these assumptions were made based on existing levels of hiv testing under conventional hiv testing promotion and pilot data evaluating crowdsourced hiv testing videos in china [ 14 ] . with eight clusters ( cities ) , four intervention time lines , a coefficient of variation of 0.4 , a 0.05 significance level , 90 % power , and 30 % loss to follow-up , we planned to recruit at least 1,040 men from the eight cities ( 130 from each city ) . the primary outcome of this study was the proportion of participants who tested for hiv over the previous 3 months . this was assessed based on self-reported data from each follow-up survey . we also measured the following secondary outcomes : facility-based hiv testing ; hiv self-testing ; syphilis testing ; condomless sex ; using wechat , weibo , qq , or mobile phone applications to give/receive information about hiv testing ; anticipated hiv stigma ; hiv testing social norms ; hiv testing self-efficacy ; and community engagement in sexual health . we adapted validated scales to measure anticipated hiv stigma [ 22 ] , hiv testing social norms [ 23 ] , hiv testing self-efficacy [ 24 ] , and increase in community engagement in sexual health during the follow-up period ( as compared to baseline ) [ 10 ] . the primary and secondary outcomes were measured at baseline and in each of the four follow-up surveys at 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 months after baseline . we also measured incident hiv testing during the study period , defined as a participants first hiv test during the study period , as well as incident hiv testing among participants who had never tested for hiv at baseline . descriptive analysis was used to summarize the demographic characteristics and hiv testing proportions . to investigate the effect of the intervention , we evaluated the difference in probability of hiv testing in the control period and in the intervention period ( including the post-intervention period ) . we applied intention-to-treat analysis utilizing generalized linear mixed models ( glmms ) to evaluate the primary and secondary study outcomes . intervention status and time indicators allowing for piecewise secular trends were considered fixed effects , while sites and individual participants with multiple measurements across the four follow-ups were considered random effects [ 25 ] . we treated all intervention periods and post-intervention periods in the same manner . the estimated intervention effect sizes ( risk ratio [ rr ] for binary outcomes , and mean difference for continuous outcomes ) were each reported with a 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) and p-value . we encountered non-convergence problems when a log-binomial glmm was used to estimate relative risk . thus , we employed a log poisson glmm model [ 26 ] . ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review committees at the guangdong provincial center for skin diseases and sti control ( guangzhou , china ) , shandong university ( jinan , china ) , university of north carolina at chapel hill ( chapel hill , nc ) , and the university of california , san francisco ( san francisco , ca ) . the trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov ( nct02796963 ) . study_participants participants were recruited from july 29 , 2016 , and followed until august 21 , 2017 . overall , the study link was clicked 39,764 times . of these , 16,193 withdrew from the survey prior to reading the consent form and 21,187 people did not meet eligibility requirements . among the remaining , 1,003 did not sign the informed consent form . ( s1 fig ) based on the predetermined randomization schedule , 383 participants from guangzhou and yantai were assigned to the first intervention group ( group 1 ) , 328 participants from jiangmen and jinan were assigned to the second group ( group 2 ) , 316 participants from zhuhai and qingdao were assigned to the third group ( group 3 ) , and 354 participants from shenzhen and jining were assigned to the fourth group ( group 4 ) ( fig 4 , s1 table ) . demographic characteristics of the participants were similar across the four groups ( table 1 ) . the majority of participants were 30 years old or younger ( 82 % ) , had never married ( 86 % ) , had a college degree or higher ( 65 % ) , had an annual income below us $ 9,500 ( 74 % ) , and had disclosed their sexual orientation ( 65 % ) . most participants ( 95 % ) identified as male and the rest identified as transgender . seventy-one percent reported their sexual orientation as tongxinglian , gay . in addition , 73 % of the participants reported that they had engaged in condomless sex in the past 3 months and 5 % tested for syphilis in the past 3 months . at baseline , 57 % of participants had never tested for hiv . overall , the proportion testing for hiv in the last 3 months increased after the intervention and this trend was maintained during the post-intervention periods ( table 2 ) . similar results were also found for each study city ( s1 table ) . the number of incident testers in each follow-up period and the number of incident testers who had never tested for hiv prior to baseline are shown in s3 table . generally , incidence of hiv testing was high during the intervention period . out of 1,219 participants who completed at least one follow-up survey , 755 ( 62 % ) unique participants self-reported that they tested for hiv at any point during the study period . of these , 642 ( 85 % ) tested during the intervention and post-intervention periods ( s3 table ) . of the 699 participants who had never tested for hiv at baseline , 390 ( 56 % ) tested at any point during the study period ( s3 table ) . a total of 395 participants reported testing only once during the follow-up period , whereas 360 participants tested during more than one follow-up period ( 211 people tested twice , 107 people tested three times , and 42 people tested four times [ s4 table ] ) . table 4 reports the results for secondary outcomes using an intention-to-treat approach . our intervention increased hiv self-testing ( rr = 1.89 , 95 % ci 1.502.38 , s6 table ; s4 text lists further statistical considerations ) . there was no difference in facility-based hiv testing between the intervention and control periods ( rr = 1.00 , 95 % ci 0.791.26 ) . the crowdsourced intervention also did not improve condom use , syphilis testing , or anticipated hiv stigma ( table 4 ) . hiv testing is an essential first step in the hiv care continuum . although hiv testing is a major global health priority , in key populations large numbers of people remain untested [ 28 ] . we recruited msm from eight chinese cities and followed individuals longitudinally for 12 months to evaluate the effect of an intervention developed through crowdsourcing on promoting hiv testing . we found that the crowdsourced intervention was effective in promoting hiv testing compared to the control period , showing an 8.9 % absolute increase ( and a 43 % relative increase ) in hiv testing during the intervention period . the intervention was particularly useful in promoting hiv self-testing . our study extends previous research on crowdsourcing by using it to develop a comprehensive hiv testing service , evaluating its effectiveness in a pragmatic trial , and assessing the long-term effect of the intervention [ 17 ] . in contrast with our study , nearly all of the limited crowdsourcing health research studies have been observational to date [ 17 ] . s1_text_protocol https :

nitrogen-fixing microbial associations are efficient and well characterized in legumes but are limited in cereals , including maize . we studied an indigenous landrace of maize grown in nitrogen-depleted soils in the sierra mixe region of oaxaca , mexico . this landrace is characterized by the extensive development of aerial roots that secrete a carbohydrate-rich mucilage . analysis of the mucilage microbiota indicated that it was enriched in taxa for which many known species are diazotrophic , was enriched for homologs of genes encoding nitrogenase subunits , and harbored active nitrogenase activity as assessed by acetylene reduction and 15n2 incorporation assays . field experiments in sierra mixe using 15n natural abundance or 15n-enrichment assessments over 5 years indicated that atmospheric nitrogen fixation contributed 29 % 82 % of the nitrogen nutrition of sierra mixe maize . nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plants , and for many nonlegume crops , the requirement for nitrogen is primarily met by the use of inorganic fertilizers . these fertilizers are produced from fossil fuel by energy-intensive processes that are estimated to use 1 % to 2 % of the total global energy supply and produce an equivalent share of greenhouse gases . because maize ( zea mays l. ) is a significant recipient of nitrogen fertilization , a research goal for decades has been to identify or engineer mechanisms for biological fixation of atmospheric nitrogen in association with this crop . we hypothesized that isolated indigenous landraces of maize grown using traditional practices with little or no fertilizer might have evolved strategies to improve plant performance under low-nitrogen nutrient conditions . here , we show that for one such maize landrace grown in nitrogen-depleted fields near oaxaca , mexico , 29 % 82 % of the plant nitrogen is derived from atmospheric nitrogen . high levels of nitrogen fixation are supported , at least in part , by the abundant production of a sugar-rich mucilage associated with aerial roots that provides a home to a complex nitrogen-fixing microbiome . introduction plants grow in close association with microbial communities that influence plant traits related to nutrient acquisition , plant development , plant defenses , and abiotic stress responses . the root-associated microbiota of plants has been characterized and shown to be much less complex than the microbiota of the surrounding soil , being enriched in proteobacteria , bacteroidetes , and actinobacteria . these microbes are selected in part by plant cell wall features and metabolic cues from host cells [ 1,2 ] . characterization of the rhizosphere microbiome associated with 27 modern maize ( z. mays ) inbred lines also indicated substantial differences in relative abundance of microbial taxa between bulk soil and the rhizosphere , with the maize genotype contributing a small but significant influence on rhizosphere selectivity [ 3 ] . sierra_mixe_maize_morphology_and_mucilage the sierra mixe maize varieties cultured locallyreferred to as rojo , piedra blanca , and llanoshare similar plant morphologies , growing to a height of over 5 meters and exhibiting extensive aerial root formation at each node . we compared the development of aerial roots in the sierra mixe maize with another tall maize variety , hickory king ( fig 1a ) . unlike most modern maize varieties in which aerial root formation ceases after the juvenile-to-adult transition ( arrow , fig 1a ) , aerial root formation in sierra mixe maize continued well after this transition , resulting in a 3- to 4-fold greater number of aerial roots ( fig 1b ) . approximately midway through development ( july to september ) , these maize aerial roots secrete significant amounts of mucilage that is rich in arabinose , fucose , and galactose when moisture is available ( fig 2 ) . the sugars comprise a complex polysaccharide that presumably contributes to the viscosity of the mucilage and may be disassembled to provide monosaccharides to support microbial growth and metabolism . mucilage produced by underground maize roots also contain high levels of fucose and arabinose [ 32 ] , although at approximately one-half the concentration found in aerial root mucilage . the microbiota associated with the underground and aerial roots , stems , and aerial root mucilage of sierra mixe maize grown in sierra mixe was investigated by amplifying and sequencing of 16s rrna genes and by shotgun metagenome sequencing . the rhizosphere samples were the most diverse , and among plant samples , the aerial root mucilage had the highest diversity ( s1 fig ) and a higher relative abundance of bacteroidetes and proteobacteria ( beta and gamma ) compared to other parts of the plants ( s2 fig ) . many of the lineages that are overrepresented in mucilage include known plant-associated nitrogen fixers . a comparison of samples based on the total community composition showed a clustering of mucilage samples that were statistically distinct from the rest of the plant and rhizosphere samples ( fig 3a ) . clustering of samples based upon the variance-stabilized abundance of sequence variants again indicates that while the rhizosphere samples were distinct and diverse , the mucilage samples were distant from the other plant tissues ( s3 fig ) . the complete list of all sequence variants identified in the sierra mixe maize and soil samples can be found at ( doi : 10.6084/m9.figshare.4789759 ) . additionally , the metagenomic data was searched for homologs of the 6 core nif genes as described by dos santos and colleagues [ 33 ] . this search revealed the presence of all 6 core nif genes in the metagenomes from mucilage and rhizosphere and only a subset of the 6 core the transfer of 15n2 from mucilage to the aerial root tissue and chlorophyll demonstrated the potential of this diazotrophic community to contribute to the nitrogen nutrition of the plant , but a major question of this study is whether the mucilage-associated diazotrophic microbiota served to transfer fixed nitrogen to fulfill , at least in part , the reduced nitrogen requirements of sierra mixe maize under field conditions . the contribution of atmospheric nitrogen fixation to sierra mixe maize was first estimated in the field using natural abundance 15n measurements [ 37,38 ] . this method relies on the relative abundance of the stable isotope 15n in the atmosphere and soil , with 15n abundance being more abundant in the soil than in the air . as a consequence , plants that derive n from the atmosphere will exhibit reduced 15n levels when compared to reference nonfixing plants . in 2006 , samples of sierra mixe maize and reference plants from the asteraceae and ranunculaceae ( families with no known nitrogen-fixing members ) growing near each other were collected from each of 2 fields . in this preliminary experiment , sierra mixe maize 15n was significantly lower than the reference plants , indicating the assimilation of atmospheric nitrogen ( s1 table ) . in 2010 , 2011 , and 2012 , the methods from [ 38,39 ] were used in experiments in sierra mixe by sampling reference species of non-nitrogen-fixing plants growing near the sierra mixe maize plants and a conventional maize variety , maiz blanco conasupo we have demonstrated that the mucilage associated with the aerial roots of sierra mixe maize can support a complex diazotrophic microbiota enriched for homologs of genes encoding nitrogenase subunits that harbor active nitrogenase activity , and that nitrogen is transferred efficiently from the nitrogen-fixing bacteria to the host plant tissues . collectively , over several years and locations , the 15n natural abundance and 15n enrichment results of 2 selections of a sierra mixe indigenous maize landrace suggest that its nitrogen nutrition when grown in its native environment is partially fulfilled by fixation of atmospheric nitrogen . nitrogen fixation is a particularly difficult phenotype to evaluate , as all the techniques available are prone to artifacts and can give different estimates for nitrogen fixation [ 42,43 ] . in this study , we used several classical techniques with sierra mixe maize and have shown over multiple locations and years that sierra mixe maize can fix nitrogen at rates ( 29 % 82 % ) not previously reported , to our knowledge , in maize . plant_material sierra mixe maize seeds were obtained in sierra mixe region of oaxaca , mexico ,

liquid bse medium . the rhizosphere and plant tissues that include stem , leaf , aerial roots , underground roots , and mucilage of sierra mixe maize were sampled during seasons 2010 , 2011 , and 2012 from fields 1 and 2 in sierra mixe . for plant endophyte analysis , tissues were surface sterilized by rinsing with mqh2o , shaken gently in 70 % ethanol for 5 minutes , placed into 1 % hypochlorite bleach , gently stirred for 10 minutes , rinsed 3 times in mqh20 , and dried in a laminar flow cabinet . roots and stems were also dissected to remove epidermal tissues before extraction . for seed endophyte analysis , embryo and endosperm of sierra mixe , hickory king , and b73 were withdrawn from the seeds by hand using a razor blade in a laminar flow cabinet and were collected in 1.5 ml sterile microcentrifuge tubes . for this study , the rhizosphere was defined as a layer of soil covering the outer surface of the root system that could be washed from roots in a buffer/detergent solution . roots were first separated and shaken to remove loosely adhering soil . all soils and plant material samples were used immediately for dna extraction . soil fertility analysis , which included physical parameters , soil reaction , and salinity , was performed in agrolab ( pachuma , mexico ) . the number of nodes with aerial roots was monitored weekly ( greenhouse ) or after 14 weeks ( field ) . the total number of aerial roots was quantified after 14 weeks . the disappearance of leaf wax and appearance of trichomes were monitored weekly to determine the transition between juvenile stage and adult stage in sierra mixe and hickory king maize . for experiments in the greenhouse , seeds of sierra mixe of fields 1 and 2 and hickory king were surface sterilized and germinated as described previously . after 1 week , the seedlings are transplanted in 40-liter pots filled with a mix of sand and perlite ( v : v ) and grown in a high-ceiling greenhouse at the biotron facility ( university of wisconsin , madison , usa ) . plants were watered twice a day for 2 minutes with half-strength of hoagland solution . for experiments in the field , 3 independent plots of 20 plants per genotype were planted , with 3 border rows ( b73 ) between each genotype . sierra mixe and teosinte plants that were grown in madison for the ara were planted in the same field at the same time . this experiment was replicated in 3 different field plots . glycosyl composition analysis was performed by combined gas chromatography/mass spectrometry ( gc/ms ) of the per-o-trimethylsilyl ( tms ) derivatives of the monosaccharide methyl glycosides produced from the sample by acidic methanolysis . methyl glycosides were first prepared from dry mucilage samples by methanolysis in 1 m hcl in methanol at 80 â°c ( 1822 hours ) , followed by re-n-acetylation with pyridine and acetic anhydride in methanol ( for detection of amino sugars ) . the samples were then per-o-trimethylsilylated by treatment with tri-sil ( pierce ) at 80 â°c ( 0.5 hours ) . gc/ms analysis of the tms methyl glycosides was performed on an hp 6890 gc interfaced to a 5975b msd , using an all tech ec-1 fused silica capillary column ( 30 m ã\\x97 0.25 mm id ) . the analysis was performed at the complex carbohydrate center research center ( ccrc ) of university of georgia , athens , usa . dna ( 80150 ng l1 ) was extracted from 100 mg of the rhizosphere plant tissues using a dna isolation kit ( mo bio laboratories , carlsbad , usa ) . the pcr control for microbial dna isolation was performed on 16s rrna genes . pcr was performed using eubacterial primers 27f ( 5-agagtttgatcctggctcag-3 ) and 1492r ( 5-ggttaccttgttacgactt-3 ) , and the product was approximately a 1,450 bp fragment . amplification was carried out with 1 m of each primer in 3 mm mgcl2 , 20 m of each dntp , 1.25 units of taq polymerase ( promega ) in a total volume of 20 l of 1x reaction buffer ( promega , madison , usa ) . pcr conditions included an initial denaturation at 95 â°c for 3 minutes followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 â°c for 1 minute , annealing at 56 â°c for 1 minute , and elongation at 72 â°c for 1.5 minutes , with a final elongation at 72 â°c for 7 minutes . dna was resolved using an agarose gel run at 100 v for 30 minutes for analysis of total dna and amplification of pcr products , respectively . gels were visualized by ethidium bromide staining under uv light in a gel documentation system . the products obtained were purified with a nucleospin gel extraction kit ( clontech , palo alto , usa ) . 16s rrna gene pcr and sequencing of rhizosphere and plant tissues were carried out using the caporaso protocol [ 45 ] . we extended the caporaso approach [ 46 ] to a dual barcode scheme for each sample and replaced the golay barcodes with a different set of illumina-compatible barcodes that were designed to balance base composition and tolerate up to 4 sequencing errors in barcode sequences . the forward primer used was aatgatacggcgaccaccgagatctacac [ barcode ] tatggtaattgtgtgccagcmgccgcggtaa , and the reverse primer was caagcagaagacggcatacgagat [ barcode ] agtcagtcagccggactachvgggtwtctaat . the barcodes used were designed to allow pooling of multiple samples within a single miseq run . ten cycles of pcr with barcoded primers were performed at low annealing temperature ( 55 â°c ) ; samples were then pooled and cleaned using a qiagen column to remove the unincorporated primers . at this stage , an additional 10 or 20 cycles of pcr were performed on the pool using the illumina paired-end flowcell primers with a higher annealing temperature ( 65 â°c ) . the resulting pcr product was subjected to qc with an agilent bioanalyzer and estimated concentration using kapa biosystems qpcr kit . the samples were diluted to the appropriate loading concentration for a miseq run , spiked with 25 % phix control library , and sequenced using an illumina miseq instrument with the manufacturers standard 150 nucleotides paired-end dual-index sequencing protocol and the custom sequencing primers . illumina sequencing libraries from the same dna extractions as above were made using an adaptation of the nextera transposase-based library construction method with multiplex barcoding . samples were then sequenced on the miseq and hiseq instruments . illumina sequences thus obtained were demultiplexed and trimmed using trimmomatic ( ver 0.33 ) [ 50 ] with the following parameter : illuminaclip 2:30:10 , headcrop:15 , leading:20 , trailing:20 , sliding window:4:20 , and minlen:100 . the reads were then screened for phix and maize sequences ( genomic , chloroplast , and mitochondrial ) using bowtie2 aligner [ 51 ] against the phix genome ( genbank acc # nc_001422.1 ) and z. mays cultivar b73 draft genome ( refseq assembly acc # gcf_000005005.2 ) . the clean reads were assigned taxonomy using kaiju [ 52 ] with the nr database . to calculate the beta diversity of the samples , we used phylosift ( ver 1.0.1 ) [ 53 ] , which identifies and places reads matching 37 conserved phylogenetic marker genes on a reference tree . from these placements , an edge-pca analysis [ 54 ] was carried using guppy [ 54 ] . peptide sequences of the 6 core nif genes ( nifh , nifd , nife , nifk , nifn , nifb ) and alternate nitrogenase ( anfg , vnfg ) from known diazotrophs as previously published [ 33 ] were retrieved from genpept as a reference . a multiple-sequence alignment of these sequences was generated as a reference alignment using clustalw2 [ 55 ] . a blast search ( e-value less_than 0.001 ) of 6 frame-translated metagenomic reads was conducted against these reference sequences . the hits were then aligned against the multiple sequences alignment of reference using clustal-omega [ 56 ] followed by generation of phylogenetic trees for every individual nif gene , using fasttree2.1 [ 57 ] with a wag model of amino acid evolution and gamma20 likelihood . the reads were assigned as belonging to the nif genes if they were inside the clade of the reference sequences . each read that had significant similarity to one of the core nif genes was further analyzed by phylogenetic analysis to confirm its assignment as one of the 6 core nif genes . the counts of nif genes thus obtained were normalized by reca counts ( determined using reca tigrfam hmm [ 58 ] with hmmer3 and an e-value cutoff of e10 ) . for ara with the mucilage , 2 ml of freshly collected mucilage from 1 or 2 aerial roots ( sierra mixe ) or several plants ( teosinte ) grown in the field were introduced in 14.5 ml vials ( wheaton , millville , usa ) that were tightly closed . for ara with added bacteria , a. brasilense , h. seropedicae , and b. unamae were grown in bse medium for 48 hours . then , bacteria were collected by centrifugation ( 5 minutes , 4,000 ã\\x97 g ) and suspended in the fahraeus medium . the 14.5 ml vials , each containing 5 ml of mucilage previously stored for several months at 20 â°c to reduce endogenous nitrogen-fixing bacteria , were inoculated with the bacterial suspension at a final od600nm = 0.01 . control tubes were prepared either without bacteria or with 5 ml of fahraeus medium instead of mucilage . then , 850 l of acetylene ( airgas ) was injected into each vial . od600nm was measured for each tube after 72 hours . for both conditions , controls without acetylene were performed in parallel . for ara with aerial roots , 1 aerial root without mucilage was introduced in each 14.5 ml vial ( 10 replicates ) . one ml of acetylene ( airgas ) was injected into each vial . for ara with seedlings , sierra mixe seedlings were inoculated with a. brasilense and grown for 3 weeks . plants were then transferred to 500 ml jars , and 50 ml the enrichment of mucilage in 15n atom was achieved by removing 4 ml of headspace gas and replacing it with 4 ml of either 15n2 ( sigma-aldrich ) or 14n2 nitrogen gas directly into a vial containing 1.0 ml of mucilage . mucilage was collected from sierra mixe maize plants grown in sierra mixe and stored at 4 â°c for up to 2 weeks between sampling and the determination of 15n2 assimilation . the mucilage samples were incubated at 37 â°c for 0 and 70 hours in the presence of 15n2 . 15n2 assimilation was stopped by freezing the mucilage samples at 20 â°c . the samples were then freeze-dried and weighed . the 15n2 analysis in the mucilage samples was performed at the uc davis stable isotope facility ( davis , usa ) and the uw-madison soil science facility ( madison , usa ) . statistical analysis was performed using systat version 10 ( chicago , usa ) . for measurement in collected mucilage , 2 ml of mucilage was introduced in a 15 ml tube . the probe ( robust oxygen mini probe , pyroscience ) was introduced 8 mm deep in the mucilage and oxygen measurements performed until stabilization of the signal was observed . control corresponds to free-oxygen concentration in the liquid fahraeus medium . one-point calibration was made in aerated water , as advised by the manufacturer . aerial roots were collected from sierra mixe maize grown at the biotron greenhouse facility ( university of wisconsin , madison , usa ) . mucilage was generated from each of these aerial roots by incubating them in 5 ml of water at room temperature for 48 hours . mucilage , along with the aerial roots , was inoculated with a. brasilense sp7 . then , 10 % 15 % ( v/v ) of 15n2 gas was pumped into the vials , and the samples were incubated at 30 â°c for 48 hours . after incubation of mucilage alone , or aerial roots alone , pheophytin extracted from these aerial roots was subjected to irms analysis . to obtain pheophytin , chlorophyll was extracted from aerial roots and converted to pheophytin by acid treatment , following as described [ 59 ] . 14n2-treated mucilage and aerial roots were used as negative controls . the proportion ( % ) of nitrogen derived from biological nitrogen fixation ( % ndfa ) was estimated from the 15n natural abundance ( expressed in delta units , ) of the sierra mixe maize ( 15nfixing plant ) and that of the reference plant species ( 15nref ) . in each of the 2011 and 2012 field seasons in sierra mixe , 90114 individual maize samples ( depending on the year ) and 270 reference plant samples , representing 810 species ( depending on the year ) of non-nitrogen-fixing plants , were analyzed . for the single time point in 2010 , 12 individual maize samples and 33 reference plant samples , representing 8 species of non-nitrogen-fixing plants , were analyzed . the reference plant species in the field were identified using universal 18s pcr analysis from dna sampled using fta plant saver card ( ge life sciences , pittsburg , usa ) simultaneously with tissue samples collected for 15n analysis . pcrs were performed using sigmas extract-n-amp plant pcr kit according to the manufacturer for sequencing and blastn comparison . for 15n natural abundance , the third-youngest leaf of sierra mixe maize or reference plants was collected from field 3 and 4 from the second to the sixth month postplanting and analyzed for n-isotope composition . total organic nitrogen was determined by kjeldahl digestion followed by steam distillation . analysis for natural 15n abundance was carried out as described by bremer and van kessel [ 38 ] . the 15n analysis was performed at in 2016 , 3 locations were chosen : field 3 , land that had not been planted to crops for over 10 years ; field 4 , land that had maize for 1 year ; and field 5 , land with continuous maize . a randomized complete block design trial was established at each site , with 5 replicates with 4 varieties . each plot consisted of 6 matas surrounded by a common border of sm2 on all sides and a double border on outside rows . a mata is the traditional planting design in the sierra mixe region , similar to a hill plot in which multiple plants are seeded together . each mata was planted with 5 seeds and thinned to 3 seeds for 18 plants per plot . matas were planted in a grid 80 ã\\x97 100 cm from each other . 15n was applied at a dose of 0.36 grams per plot in a liquid solution , reaching the desired enrichment of 1 % for all 3 fields , with 50 ml added per mata . data were analyzed using the r lme4 package . data were checked for outliers and subjected to anova and mean separation using least significant difference ( p = 0.05 ) for each location . lsds were calculated only when anova f-tests were significant at p = 0.05 . for % ndfa and % ndiff , single-degree-of-freedom contrasts were calculated to compare test varieties to the mean of the reference varieties ( p greater than 0.05 ) . pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between % ndfa and % ndiff . s1_fig_box_plot_indicating_the_alpha_diversity_as_calculated_by_phyloseq_using_ ( a ) _simpson_index_and_ ( b )

treatment is not well understood . here , we report the results of a cluster-randomized trial where communities that had received 4 years of treatments were then randomized to continuation or discontinuation of treatment . in all , 48 communities with 3,938 children aged 09 years at baseline in northern ethiopia had received 4 years of annual or twice yearly mass azithromycin distribution as part of the tana i trial . we randomized these communities to either continuation or discontinuation of treatment . individuals in the communities in the continuation arm were offered either annual or twice yearly distribution of a single directly observed dose of oral azithromycin . the primary outcome was community prevalence of ocular chlamydial infection in a random sample of children aged 09 years , 36 months after baseline . we also assessed the change from baseline to 36 months in ocular chlamydia prevalence within each arm . we compared 36-month ocular chlamydia prevalence in communities randomized to continuation versus discontinuation in a model adjusting for baseline ocular chlamydia prevalence . a secondary prespecified analysis assessed the rate of change over time in ocular chlamydia prevalence between arms . in the continuation arm , mean antibiotic coverage was greater than 90 % at all time points . in the discontinuation arm , the mean prevalence of infection in children aged 09 years increased from 8.3 % ( 95 % ci 4.2 % to 12.4 % ) at 0 months to 14.7 % ( 95 % ci 8.7 % to 20.8 % , p = 0.04 ) at 36 months . ocular chlamydia prevalence in communities where mass azithromycin distribution was continued was 7.2 % ( 95 % ci 3.3 % to 11.0 % ) at baseline and in this study , ocular chlamydia infection rebounded after 4 years of periodic mass azithromycin distribution . continued distributions did not completely eliminate infection in all communities or meet who control goals , although they did prevent resurgence . this study was prospectively registered at clinicaltrials.gov ( clinicaltrials.gov nct01202331 ) . why_was_this_study_done ? mass distribution of azithromycin is a key component of the world health organizations safe ( surgery for trichiasis , antibiotics , facial cleanliness , and environmental improvement ) strategy for trachoma control [ 13 ] . antibiotics ( azithromycin ) , facial cleanliness , and environmental improvements ( e.g. , latrinization and water improvements ) are interventions aimed at reducing community transmission of the strains of ocular chlamydia that cause trachoma [ 4,5 ] . although facial cleanliness and environmental improvements are associated with decreased clinical trachoma , we have no evidence that facial hygiene or environmental improvements have any effect on ocular chlamydia [ 68 ] . on the other hand , a single mass azithromycin distribution has been shown to dramatically reduce the prevalence of ocular chlamydia [ 9,10 ] . the who currently recommends 3 to 5 rounds of annual mass azithromycin distributions for communities in which the district prevalence of trachomatous inflammationfollicular ( tf ) among 1- to 9-year-old children exceeds 10 % , followed by an impact survey to assess whether treatment should be continued . if the district prevalence of tf is below 10 % during the impact survey , then community-level surveys should be done , and any communities with a prevalence of tf less_than 5 % should have mass antibiotic treatments discontinued [ 11 ] . tana ( trachoma amelioration in northern amhara , clinicaltrials.gov nct00322972 ) was a community-randomized trial that compared different mass azithromycin strategies for reducing ocular chlamydial infection in a hyperendemic area of ethiopia . the present report describes 4 arms from its continuation trial , tripartite international research for the elimination of trachoma ( tiret ) ( clinicaltrials.gov nct01202331 ) , also known as and referred to here as tana ii . the trial received ethical approval from the university of california , san francisco ; emory university ; and the ethiopian ministry of science and technology . because illiteracy was common among study participants , we obtained verbal informed consent for all study procedures . caregivers provided verbal consent for children to participate , and community leaders provided consent for their community to participate in the study . tana i was a cluster-randomized trial conducted in the goncha siso enese woreda ( district ) of the amhara region of ethiopia from june 1 , 2006 , to december 2 , 2009 [ 18 ] . all communities in the district were eligible for randomization excluding the town of gindewoin , as it is a semi-urban area with a lower prevalence of trachoma . in the trial , we randomized 72 government-defined subdivisions known as subkebeles to 1 of 6 different treatment strategies , including 12 subkebeles to annual mass azithromycin treatments and 12 subkebeles to biannual mass azithromycin treatments ( fig 1 ) . subkebeles consisted of 46 government-defined units known as state teams ( communities ) . we treated all communities of the subkebele identically , and performed monitoring for ocular chlamydia in a single sentinel state team from the subkebele . we collected conjunctival swabs every 6 months from a random sample of community members , and processed swabs for chlamydia testing using amplicor ct ( roche molecular diagnostics , pleasanton , ca ) . we conducted the tana ii continuation trial from november 1 , 2010 , until november 8 , 2013 . the tana ii trial population consisted of 48 state teams that had received annual mass azithromycin distributions and 24 state teams that had received biannual mass azithromycin distributions during tana i . state teams were randomly selected stratified by subkebele , with 4 state teams from each of the 12 annually treated subkebeles and 2 state teams from each of the 12 biannually treated subkebeles . we randomized the 4 state teams in each annually treated subkebele to 1 of the following treatment strategies : ( 1 ) discontinuation of mass treatments , ( 2 ) continued annual mass azithromycin treatments , ( 3 ) azithromycin treatments targeted to preschool children , or ( 4 ) azithromycin treatments targeted to households containing children with clinically active trachoma . we randomized the 2 state teams from each biannually treated subkebele to either discontinuation of mass treatments or to continued biannual mass azithromycin distributions . as depicted in fig 1 , the present report includes 48 state teams randomized into 4 treatment groups : continuation of annual mass azithromycin ( n = 12 ) , cessation of annual mass azithromycin ( n = 12 ) , continuation of biannual mass azithromycin ( n = 12 ) , and cessation of biannual mass azithromycin ( n = 12 ) . the 2-stage randomization means that these 4 groups were randomly drawn from the same underlying population and can thus be tcp performed the randomization in the statistical package r ( r foundation for statistical computing , vienna , austria ) . state teams from the annual and biannual arms of tana i were randomized to discontinue or continue their treatment strategy . all state teams were enrolled prior to randomization . study participants were not masked to their state teams treatment allocation . field staff were not informed of , and laboratory personnel were masked to , the state teams treatment allocation . in both tana i and tana ii , we performed an annual door-to-door enumerative census . in state teams assigned to treatment , azithromycin was offered to all community members aged 6 months and up ( approximately 20 mg/kg using height-based dosing for children , up to a maximum of 1 g ) [ 19 ] . children less than 6 months , pregnant women , and those allergic to macrolide antibiotics were offered 2 tubes of topical tetracycline instead , to be used twice daily for 6 weeks . antibiotic coverage was defined as the proportion of individuals from the most recent census who received either oral azithromycin or topical tetracycline . an adverse event notification system was put in place for individuals to notify the village informant and the ethiopian study coordinator . the primary outcome was prevalence of ocular chlamydia infection as detected by pcr . active trachoma was a prespecified secondary outcome and is included in this report as it is an important component of monitoring trachoma control programs [ 20 ] . we performed annual assessments in the same populations as in tana i : a random sample of 50 children aged 09 years and a random sample of 50 individuals aged 10 years and older ( adults ) from each state team based on the most recent census . to assess active trachoma , at each monitoring visit , we examined the everted upper right tarsal conjunctiva for signs of trachoma according to the who simplified trachoma grading system , specifically assessing the presence of tf and trachomatous inflammationintense . to assess ocular chlamydia , we then collected a conjunctival specimen by passing a dacron swab 3 times against the everted tarsal conjunctiva , rotating the swab 120â° between each pass . we stored swabs on ice for less_than8 hours while in the field , then at 20â°c until transport to the lab , at 4â°c for less_than24 hours during transport , and finally at 80â°c until processing . we performed chlamydial testing with the abbott m2000 platform on pools of 5 randomly selected swabs , with pools stratified by community and age group . we estimated the prevalence of infection most likely to have resulted in the pooled result , as previously described [ 21 ] . the sample size was based on the primary outcome for the discontinuation and continuation arms , with assumptions based on the results of previous studies ( the trachoma elimination follow-up study and tana i ) [ 18,22 ] . the standard deviation after 1 year of treatment in tana i was 0.043 , and we conservatively assumed a standard deviation of 0.05 for sample size planning . for assessment of rebound of ocular chlamydia following discontinuation of treatment , a sample size of 12 state teams per arm was determined to provide approximately 80 % power to detect a difference of 5 % assuming a paired t test . for comparison of continued annual versus continued biannual treatment , a sample size of 12 state teams per arm was determined to provide approximately 80 % power to detect a 6 % difference in ocular chlamydia prevalence . all analyses were conducted at the level of the unit of randomization , the state team , to account for the clustered design of the trial . we estimated the prevalence of ocular chlamydia and active trachoma in each state team at the community level as described above . the prespecified primary outcome was the prevalence of ocular chlamydia in children aged 09 years at 36 months after the baseline visit of tana ii . all analyses were conducted in stata 14.2 ( statacorp , college station , tx ) . during the first tana trial , 12 subkebeles received 4 annual mass azithromycin distributions and 12 subkebeles received 8 biannual mass azithromycin distributions over 3 years , with antibiotic coverage generally exceeding 80 % in each community [ 18 ] . the results of the tana i trial have been reported previously [ 18 ] . briefly , the prevalence of ocular chlamydial infection in 0- to 9-year-olds as assessed by amplicor decreased in both of the treatment groups after 3 years of repeated mass azithromycin distributions , from 41.9 % to 1.9 % in the annual group and from 38.3 % to 3.2 % in the biannual group . the baseline visit for tana ii took place 54 months after the baseline tana i visit , which was 18 months after the final mass azithromycin distribution in the annually treated group , and 12 months after the final mass azithromycin distribution in the biannually treated group . community characteristics for the baseline tana ii visit are shown in table 1 . antibiotic coverage during tana ii for the 24 communities randomized to continuation of annual or biannual mass azithromycin distribution generally exceeded 80 % at each distribution ( table 2 ) . no adverse events were reported in the study . although continuation of mass azithromycin distribution led to reduced prevalence of ocular chlamydia compared to communities in which distribution was discontinued , this study demonstrates that even 7 rounds of mass azithromycin were not sufficient for elimination in an area with hyperendemic trachoma . we initially hypothesized that several rounds of mass azithromycin distributions might completely eliminate ocular chlamydia [ 18 ] . previous work with topical tetracycline ointment indicated that antibiotics alone would not be sufficient to achieve trachoma elimination [ 23 ] . however , limitations of topical tetracycline , including long treatment duration and poor adherence , may reduce its effectiveness [ 24 ] . single-dose azithromycin can overcome many of these limitations , although previous work has indicated ongoing transmission of ocular chlamydia even after 3 years of implementation of the safe strategy in a hyperendemic region of ethiopia [ 25 ] . in the present study , in communities that had previously received 4 years of repeated mass azithromycin distributions , the prevalence of both clinically active trachoma and ocular chlamydia infection stabilized if mass treatments were continued , and increased if mass treatments were stopped . continuing antibiotic distributions was superior to discontinuing treatments , arguing for continued rounds of antibiotics if the goal is maintaining low levels of ocular chlamydia . s1_consort_checklist_consort_checklist https : //doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002633.s001 https :

order to validate the test , sera from laboratory-bred beagles experimentally exposed to p. perniciosus bites were used as positive controls . additionally , all samples were tested by elisa using whole salivary gland homogenate ( sgh ) and the rsp03b protein as antigen . an almost perfect degree of agreement was found between the ict and the sgh-elisa . furthermore , the newly proposed rsp03b sero-strip showed a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 86.79 % . we developed a simple and rapid ict based on the p. perniciosus rsp03b salivary protein , able to replace the standard elisa used in previous studies . our rsp03b sero-strip showed to be highly sensitive and specific in the detection of antibodies ( igg ) against p. perniciosus saliva . in the future , this test can be employed during large-scale epidemiological studies of canl in the mediterranean area to evaluate the efficacy of vector control programs . the sand fly phlebotomus perniciosus is the principle vector of leishmania infantum , causing canine leishmaniasis in the mediterranean basin . while the sand fly female takes a blood meal , it injects saliva into the host skin , evoking a specific antibody response in the host . the antibody level in the host correlates with the intensity of exposure to sand flies . previously , the specific antibody response ( igg ) against a salivary protein of p. perniciosussp03bhas been proposed as a valid biomarker to estimate dog exposure to p. perniciosus in the mediterranean area . since standard serological methods are impractical and time-consuming in field conditions , we propose the rsp03b sero-stripa rapid test that can be immediately applied to screen large cohorts of dogs for the presence of anti-p. perniciosus antibodies . our test is the first rapid test in the field of vector exposure , it is highly sensitive and specific and shown to be a valid replacement for standard serological assays . in addition , this test could be used as an evaluation tool for vector control programs . canine leishmaniasis ( canl ) is a widespread zoonotic disease present in several countries in latin-america , europe and asia [ 1,2 ] . it is a severe multi-systemic disease of dogs caused by the protozoan parasite leishmania infantum . the disease manifests itself in variable clinical signs , with the majority of dogs experiencing poor body condition , generalized muscular atrophy , lymphadenomegaly and excessive skin scaling ( reviewed in [ 3 ] ) . canl is endemic across the mediterranean basin [ 1,2 ] , with seroprevalences varying from region to region depending on ecological aspects [ 4 ] . overall , 2.5 million dogs are estimated to be infected in southern europe [ 4 ] . since dogs suffering from the disease are extremely difficult to treat , it is not surprising that the high incidence of canl in southern europe represents the main cause of deaths amongst dogs in the region [ 5 ] . however , recent occurrence of autochtonous cases in romania , hungary and northern italy suggests that the disease is not limited anymore to the mediterranean region , but confirms its spread to more northern areas ( reviewed in [ 6 ] ) . it is noteworthy that less than 50 % of infected dogs develop the disease [ 7 ] . however , both sick and asymptomatic dogs represent the main reservoir of the parasite and form a risk for human disease , zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis ( zvl ) [ 3,5 ] . in the mediterranean region ethics_statement reuse of canine sera samples obtained during previous studies [ 11,26 ] was approved by the ethical board of charles university . ethical approval of sera samples collected from non-bitten laboratory-bred beagles housed at the university of zaragoza , spain ( unizar ) was obtained during another ongoing study , protocol pi44/17 . all sampling complied with the european guidelines on the protection of animals ( directive 2010/ 63/ue ) . forty-two sera samples from laboratory-bred beagles experimentally exposed to p. perniciosus were used to prepare the first prototype of the test . these dogs were individually exposed to approximately 200 p. perniciosus females during a previous study . the sampling protocol is described in more detail in [ 11 ] . negative control sera were collected from 29 non-bitten laboratory-bred beagles housed at the university of zaragoza , spain ( unizar ) . furthermore , sera samples from 24 laboratory-bred beagles born in a breeding facility located in northern france were used as negative controls . the antigen ( ag ) used for the preparation of the rsp03b sero-strip is a bacterially expressed 43kda yellow-related recombinant protein of p. perniciosus ( rsp03b , genbank accn . dq150622 ) . the recombinant protein was obtained from apronex s.r.o . ( prague ) as described in [ 29 ] and was expressed with the escherichia coli bl21 ( de3 ) expression system in the pet28b vector ( novagen ) with a poly-his tag ( 6 histidines ) . the protein was isolated under denaturing conditions with 8m urea ( 50mm tris , ph 8 , 300mm sodium chloride ) and prepared for usage in the rsp03b sero-strip by gradually dialyzing it to a final concentration of 0m urea ( pbs 1x , ph 6 ) using slide-a-lyzer mini dialysis units ( 10k mwco , 0.1ml ) , following the manufacturers protocol . the uv absorbance value of the protein was determined by nanodrop at 280nm . the protein concentration was then quantified by means of the known molar extinction coefficient of the protein . the rsp03b sero-strip is composed of a lower absorbent pad and an upper absorbent pad that both overlap a nitrocellulose ( nc ) membrane located in the middle of the test ( fig 1 ) . the lower absorbent pad is impregnated with a colloidal gold-conjugate consisting of a mixture of one conjugate for the test line and one for the control line . the conjugate for the test line was prepared by coupling a polyclonal anti-dog igg ab ( bethyl laboratories ) to colloidal gold nanoparticles . secondly , the control conjugate was prepared by coupling a chicken ab from non-immunized chickens to colloidal gold nanoparticles . the coupling of both conjugates was followed by a saturation step ( gold blocking buffer , coris bioconcept ) . on the nc membrane 3 lines were coated . the first line consists of sample deposition line and enables a complete migration of the sample . the second line is the test line on which the dialyzed rsp03b protein is coated ( 0.6mg/ml , 0.1l/mm ) and the third line ( migration control ) consists of a goat anti-chicken ab ( gac ) that binds to the colloidal gold control conjugate . in order to launch the test , a buffer ( 3l ; hc dilution buffer , coris bioconcept ) is applied to the sample line ( blue ) on the nc membrane ( step 1 in fig 2 ) . immediately after applying the buffer , the serum sample ( 1l ) is deposited on the same spot ( step 2 in fig 2 ) . this will cause the sample to start migrating to the upper part of the strip , where the anti-rsp03b abs present in the serum sample will be captured by the rsp03b ag coated on the test line ( step 3 and 4 in fig 2 ) . directly after deposition of the sample , the strip is dipped into the migration buffer solution ( step 4 in fig 2 ; ly-b dilution buffer , coris bioconcept ) . the colloidal gold conjugate , consisting of the test- and control-conjugate mixture , gets hydrated and starts migrating upwards together with the moving liquid ( step 5 in fig 2 ) . once arrived at the test line , the conjugate will recognize dog igg abs bound to the rsp03b ag coated at the test line ( step 6 in fig 2 ) . while moving further up the nc membrane , the gac abs present at the control line will capture the colloidal gold control conjugate , resulting in the appearance of a purple color . this is an essential part of the rsp03b sero-strip as it ensures that the migration all samples tested in elisa were tested in duplicate . the coefficient of variation ( cov ) was calculated for each duplicate sample . if the cov was more than 15 % the sample was retested . since plates were ran on multiple days , positive control sera ( pc , n = 2 ) and negative control sera ( nc , n = 2 ) were included in each plate . in order to correct for interplate variability , the obtained od values were standardized ( sod ) according to the following formula : sensitivity_and_specificity_of_each_serological_method the specificity and sensitivity of the 3 serological methods used were calculated based on the results from experimentally exposed dogs and negative control sera ( table 1 ) . the distribution of the results in sod ( % ) is shown in fig 5 . results from the sgh-elisa and rsp03b-elisa were first classified as being positive or negative according to their respective cut-off value ( fig 5a and 5b ) . all 42 sera of dogs experimentally exposed to p. perniciosus appeared positive on the sgh-elisa . however , only 29 out of these 42 samples were classified as being positive in the rsp03b-elisa . additionally , a single serum sample out of 53 negative control sera was found to be positive in the sgh-elisa , and rsp03b-elisa . these observations resulted in a sensitivity of 100 % and 69 % for the sgh-elisa and rsp03b-elisa , respectively , and a specificity of 98.11 % for both methods . results obtained from our newly prepared rsp03b sero-strip were classified according to the intensity of the observed band . the distribution of the samples tested by the rsp03b sero-strip is shown in fig 5c . all 42 sera samples of experimentally exposed dogs presented 2 purple bandsone on the test line and one on the control lineresulting in a sensitivity of 100 % . on the other hand , 7 out of 53 sera from non-bitten negative controls were also found positive with our rsp03b sero-strip , giving it a specificity of 86.79 % . importantly since the sgh-elisa showed the highest sensitivity and specificity amongst all 3 methods , it was set as the golden standard against which the rsp03b-elisa and the rsp03b sero-strip were evaluated ( table 2 ) . the sensitivity and specificity of the rsp03b sero-strip as compared to the sgh-elisa were 97.67 % and 87 % , respectively . a percentage of agreement of 91.58 % was obtained with no systematic difference between the proportions of positive responses from these two methods ( mcnemar 2 p greater than 0.05 ) . furthermore , the cohens kappa value between the rsp03b sero-strip and the sgh-elisa was 0.83 , suggesting an almost perfect strength of agreement between these two methods . with regard to the rsp03b-elisa a sensitivity and specificity of 67.44 % and 98 % were measured , respectively . the percentage of agreement between the rsp03b-elisa and the sgh-elisa was set at 84.21 % with a cohens kappa value of 0.67 , suggesting a substantial strength of agreement . however , mcnemar 2 tested a significant systematic difference between the proportions of positive responses from the rsp03b-elisa and the sgh-elisa ( p less_than 0.05 ) . interestingly , when raw od-values of both elisa methods were compared , a correlation of 83.43 % was obtained ( 95 % ci [ 76.06 % 88.67 % ] , p less_than 0.001 ) ( fig 5d ) . previous studies addressing the level of host exposure to sand fly bites consistently used elisa methods to determine the levels of specific anti-vector salivary abs . although this method is useful in laboratory settings , a rapid test that can aid in vector control by allowing a consistent screening of hosts in the field has not yet been described . here , we developed a new rapid test that can be immediately used in the field to screen dogs living in endemic canl areas for the presence of anti-p. perniciosus igg abs . in the proposed rsp03b sero-strip , the yellow-related rsp03b p. perniciosus salivary protein was used as ag , previously proposed as a valid exposure marker for p. perniciosus across its entire area of distribution [ 22 ] . the principle of the rsp03b sero-strip is similar to an indirect elisa ; first specific canine abs present in the sample bind to the p. perniciosus salivary ag immobilized on the nc membrane of the sero-strip , after which the interaction is visualized by an anti-dog igg ab gold-conjugate . we gratefully thank sonia ares gomez and montserrat gã¡llego cullerã© for their help and providing us with blood samples from non-bitten laboratory and field dogs in spain . special thanks go to tatiana spitzova for her professional support throughout this study .']\n","\n","Summary\n","['background canine leishmaniasis ( canl ) is a zoonotic disease caused by leishmania infantum and transmitted by phlebotomus perniciosus in the mediterranean basin. <n> the sand fly phlebotomus perniciosus is the principal vector of canl. <n> the sand fly female takes a blood meal, it injects saliva into the host skin, evoking a specific antibody response in the host. <n> previously, the specific antibody response ( igg ) against a salivary protein of p. perniciosus sp03bhas was proposed as a valid biomarker to estimate dog exposure to p. perniciosus in the mediterranean basin. since standard serological methods are impractical and time - consuming in field conditions, we propose the rsp03b sero-stripa rapid test that can be immediately applied to screen large cohorts of dogs for the presence of anti - p. perniciosus antibodies. <n> our test is the first rapid test in the field of vector exposure, it is highly sensitive and specific and shown to be a valid replacement for standard serological assays. in addition, this test could be\\n']\n","\n","==================================================\n","BLEU: 53.774\n","ROUGE: 26.724\n","ROUGE-F: 36.686\n","SARI: 40.930\n","Article\n","['foam cells are lipid-laden macrophages that contribute to the inflammation and tissue damage associated with many chronic inflammatory disorders . although foam cell biogenesis has been extensively studied in atherosclerosis , how these cells form during a chronic infectious disease such as tuberculosis is unknown . here we report that , unlike the cholesterol-laden cells of atherosclerosis , foam cells in tuberculous lung lesions accumulate triglycerides . consequently , the biogenesis of foam cells varies with the underlying disease . in vitro mechanistic studies showed that triglyceride accumulation in human macrophages infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis is mediated by tnf receptor signaling through downstream activation of the caspase cascade and the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 ( mtorc1 ) . these features are distinct from the known biogenesis of atherogenic foam cells and establish a new paradigm for non-atherogenic foam cell formation . moreover , they reveal novel targets for disease-specific pharmacological interventions against maladaptive macrophage responses . the formation of foam cells ( lipid-laden macrophages ) is a maladaptive host response associated with chronic inflammation . foam cell biogenesis has been most thoroughly studied in atherosclerosis , where it is linked to disruption of cholesterol homeostasis and consequent intracellular accumulation of cholesteryl esters . in this study , we show that , during pulmonary tuberculosis , foam cells found in necrotizing granulomas ( tubercles ) accumulate predominantly triglycerides rather than cholesteryl esters . triglyceride profiles are highly conserved across lung granulomas in rabbits , non-human primates , and humans . we also show that triglyceride accumulation in human primary macrophages infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis involves tnf receptor signaling and downstream activation of mtorc1 and caspase pathways . our finding that tuberculous foam cells differ from atherogenic foam cells with respect to storage lipid composition and lipid accumulation mechanism reveals that foam cell formation is a disease-specific process . the results of this study point to novel targets for pharmacological intervention against tuberculosis and help explain links between tuberculosis and insulin resistance . formation of foam cells ( lipid-laden macrophages ) is a manifestation of maladaptive responses occurring during chronic inflammatory conditions [ 1 ] . the best-studied case is that of atherosclerosis . there , retention of lipoproteins in the arterial intima triggers extravasation of circulating monocytes and subsequent accumulation of lipids , predominantly cholesteryl esters , in the cytoplasm of monocyte-derived macrophages . the resulting foam cells exhibit impaired immune functions ; they also produce pro-inflammatory mediators and release cellular content upon death [ 2 ] . by maintaining inflammation and failing to resolve it , foam cells contribute to a chronic inflammatory state and consequently to tissue damage [ 2 , 3 ] . foam cells are observed well beyond the hyperlipidemia associated with atherosclerosis : these lipid-laden macrophages are found in many diseases of non-infectious ( e.g. , autoimmune ) and infectious ( e.g. , hiv , tuberculosis ) etiology , where foam cells are often central to pathogenesis [ 4 ] . since these diseases are associated with chronic inflammation rather than hyperlipidemia , the mechanisms triggering foam cell formation in these pathologies may differ from those occurring during atherosclerosis . whether that is the case is currently unknown . triglycerides_are_the_dominant_storage_lipids_in_the_tuberculous_granuloma since storage lipids in foam cells are primarily ce and/or tag , we measured the abudance of these two lipid classes in tuberculous lung lesions . we also measured levels of free cholesterol since this lipid has been implicated in tuberculosis pathogenesis ( reviewed in [ 8 ] ) . for these analyses , we used rabbits and marmosets ( a small , new world monkey ) since , when experimentally infected with m. tuberculosis , these animal species develop necrotizing granulomas similar to those found in human tuberculosis [ 22 , 23 ] ( fig 1a , 1b , 1c and 1d ) . three lung regions were separately sampled by laser capture microdissection : the caseum and surrounding cellular region of granulomas , and the uninvolved lung ( see fig 1a , 1b , 1c and 1d for haematoxylin and eosin staining , fig 1f and 1g and s1 video for nile red staining , and s1 fig for laser capture microdissection ) . tag and ce species and free cholesterol were individually quantified in the microdissected samples by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ( lc-ms ) ( lipid standards are listed in s1 table ) . total tag , ce , and free cholesterol are shown in fig 1h and 1i . we found that the amount of tag was higher in the caseum and cellular regions of the lesions relative to the uninvolved lung tissue in both animal species ( up to 6-fold ) ( fig 1h and 1i ) . in contrast , in principle it is desirable to assess the characteristics of tuberculous lesions in humans . however , when we quantified the storage lipids in microdissected caseum and surrounding cellular areas of lung lesions from two multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients ( see s2a , s2b and s2c fig for histopathological and drug treatment information ) , we found that the relative abundance of ce species varied greatly between the two donors ( s2d fig for total tag and ce content ; s2 and s3 tables for individual tag and ce species ) . thus , no conclusion could be drawn in terms of predominance of one storage lipid over the other , due to small sample size , the potential confounding effects of prolonged lung disease and antibiotic treatment , and/or additional donor-specific variables . to characterize the underlying mechanism of tuberculosis-induced tag accumulation , we examined human monocyte-derived macrophages ( mdm ) infected in vitro with m. tuberculosis . we first focused on the effect of infection on storage lipid content of these macrophages using lc-ms. we observed a 2.5-fold increase in tag levels due to infection ( fig 3a ) . the tag species profile ( s2 table ) was similar to that observed in the necrotizing granulomas taken from patients ( s3 fig ) , and levels of ce were below the limit of quantification . the elevated tag levels in infected cells were accompanied by higher lipid droplet content relative to that of uninfected cells ( ~8-fold ) , as detected by imaging flow cytometry ( fig 3b ) . furthermore , lipid droplet accumulation was abolished when infected macrophages were treated with a chemical inhibitor ( a922500 ) of the dgat1 enzyme , which mediates the conversion of di- to tri-glycerides ( fig 3c ) . collectively , these data show that tag is the dominant lipid in lipid droplets formed in m. tuberculosis-infected macrophages . consistent with the observed tag accumulation , macrophage infection also increased expression of sentinel tag biosynthesis genes , as determined by rt-pcr ( fig 3d ) . based on the results described above , we used lipid droplet levels as a surrogate measure of tag levels in mdm . imaging flow cytometric analysis of lipid droplets in m. tuberculosis-infected macrophages makes it possible to co-localize lipid droplets ( stained with the fluorescent dye bodipy 493/503 ) with intracellular tubercle bacilli ( expressing the fluorescent protein mcherry ) . within the cultures of infected macrophages , macrophages that lacked intracellular bacilli ( mcherry negative ) also exhibited elevated lipid droplet content , albeit at a lower level than bacilli-bearing cells ( mcherry positive ) ( the comparison with non-infected cells was statistically significant for both mcherry-positive and mcherry-negative cells ) ( fig 4a ) . this observation indicated that a paracrine signal may be associated with infection-induced lipid droplet accumulation . we next sought to identify cellular functions regulated by tnf signaling that are involved in tag accumulation in m. tuberculosis-infected macrophages . binding of tnf to its receptors activates multiple signaling pathways that collectively regulate cellular metabolism , cell proliferation , cell survival , and inflammatory responses ( fig 5a ) [ 27 , 29 ] . these pathways include : ( i ) the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 ( mtorc1 ) signaling pathway , which promotes cell metabolism and growth [ 30 ] ; ( ii ) the caspase cascade , which leads to inflammation and cell death [ 31 ] ; ( iii ) signaling pathways regulated by the nuclear factor kappa b ( nf-b ) , and ( iv ) signaling regulated by the mitogen-activated protein kinases ( mapk ) , which regulate inflammation , cell proliferation , and cell survival [ 32 , 33 ] . we examined each of the above pathways for a role in infection-induced lipid droplet accumulation by treating infected macrophages with pathway-specific chemical inhibitors . inhibitors of the mapk and nf-b pathways had no effect or induced only a modest increase ( 1.5 fold ) in lipid droplet content of the infected cells ( fig 5a ) . the pronounced lipid droplet increase seen with cells from some donors is consistent with the notion that nf-b mediates the lipolytic effects of tnf [ 34 ] . in sharp contrast , the lipid droplet content of infected macrophages decreased by 50 % when the cells were the present report shows that the dominant type of storage lipid found in the necrotic and foam-cell-rich regions of tuberculous granulomas is tag ; moreover , the accumulation of this lipid class in m. tuberculosis-infected macrophages is driven by tnf receptor signaling , by downstream activation of the metabolic master regulator mtorc1 , and by the caspase cascade . both mtorc1 signaling and caspase activation regulate transcription factors ( sterol regulatory element-binding proteins , srebps ) involved in tag biosynthesis [ 40 , 41 , 44 , 51 ] , and both block autophagy [ 42 , 52 ] , which is a major cellular lipid catabolic process [ 53 ] . thus , increased tag biosynthesis and/or inhibition of autophagy may be driving tag accumulation in macrophages during m. tuberculosis infection . by characterizing the chemical nature of the dominant storage lipid in tuberculous foam cells and the underlying accumulation mechanisms , our work opens a new avenue of investigation into relationships between the human host and its deadliest pathogen [ 54 ] . ethics_statement animal studies were carried out in accordance with the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals of the national institutes of health [ 91 ] , with approval from the institutional animal care and use committee of the new jersey medical school , rutgers university , newark , nj ( iacuc protocol number 16016d0319 ) and of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases ( niaid ) , national institutes of health ( nih ) , bethesda , md ( iacuc protocol number a-4149-01 ) . adults with pulmonary mdr-tb scheduled for elective lung resection surgery were asked to participate in the study pharmacokinetics of standard first and second line anti-tb drugs in the lung and lesions of subjects elected for resection surgery ( clinicaltrials.gov nct00816426 ) . all subjects provided written informed consent . the institutional review boards of the niaid , nih and the pusan national university hospital , asan medical center , and national medical center approved the study [ 92 ] . the procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the helsinki declaration [ 93 ] . human monocyte-derived macrophages ( mdm ) were infected in vitro with m. tuberculosis h37rv . rabbits were infected with m. tuberculosis hn878 , and marmosets were infected with m. tuberculosis cdc1551 . all m. tuberculosis strains , which are fully drug susceptible , belong to different lineages [ 94 ] . a total of ten rabbits were infected using a nose-only aerosol exposure system , and they were sacrificed at 1216 weeks post-infection ( four at phri and six at the niaid ) using established protocols [ 95 , 96 ] . nine marmosets were infected by the aerosol route , as described [ 23 ] , and sacrificed at 68 weeks post-infection . lung tissue samples containing lesions showing advanced necrosis ( characterized by the presence of caseum ) and areas of tissue free from visible lesions ( uninvolved lung ) were collected from all animals and frozen in liquid nitrogen vapor , as described [ 97 ] . tissue sections that were 25 m thick were cut from gamma-irradiated lung tissue samples using a microm hn505 n ( walldorf , germany ) and thaw-mounted onto 1.4 m-thick leica pet-membrane frameslides ( herborn , germany ) for laser capture microdissection [ 92 ] . tissue sections were immediately transferred into sealed containers and stored at -80â°c . adjacent 12 m-thick tissue sections were thaw-mounted onto standard glass microscope slides for haematoxylin and eosin staining . caseum and cellular areas in lesions were identified optically from a bright-field image scan and by comparison to the adjacently sectioned haematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue ( s1 fig ) . equal areas ( totaling 5 million m2 ) of cellular ( 300 m-wide regions surrounding the caseum ) and caseous regions of necrotizing lung granulomas were dissected from three serial sections of lung tissue using a leica lmd6500 system ( buffalo grove , il , usa ) ( s1 fig ) . the mass of each pooled sample was calculated based on the surface area and tissue thickness of the pooled sections and an assumed tissue density of 1 g/ml , as previously described [ 98 , 99 ] . pooled dissected material was collected into 0.25 ml standard pcr tubes and immediately transferred to -80â°c for storage . lc-ms analysis was performed on a q exactive high-resolution mass spectrometer ( thermo fisher scientific , waltham , ma , usa ) coupled to a thermo scientific dionex ultimate 3000 binary system . chromatography was performed with a kinetex c18 column ( 2.1 x 50 mm ;

associated with many chronic inflammatory disorders. <n> although foam cell biogenesis has been extensively studied in atherosclerosis, how these cells form during a chronic infectious disease such as tuberculosis is unknown. here <n> we report that, unlike the cholesterol-laden cells of atherosclerosis, foam cells in tuberculous lung lesions accumulate predominantly in lipids rather than cholesteryl esters. <n> we also show that accumulation in human primary macrophages infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis involves tnf receptor signaling and downstream activation of mtorc1 and caspase pathways. <n> our finding that tuberculous foam cells differ from atherogenic foam cells with respect to storage lipid composition and lipid accumulation mechanism reveals that foam cell formation is a disease- specific process. <n> the results of this study point to novel targets for pharmacological intervention against tuberculosis and help explain links between tuberculosis and

life . accessing iron from the environment can be a limiting factor that determines success in a given environmental niche . for bacteria , access of chelated iron from the environment is often mediated by tonb-dependent transporters ( tbdts ) , which are -barrel proteins that form sophisticated channels in the outer membrane . reports of iron-bearing proteins being used as a source of iron indicate specific protein import reactions across the bacterial outer membrane . the molecular mechanism by which a folded protein can be imported in this way had remained mysterious , as did the evolutionary process that could lead to such a protein import pathway . how does the bacterium evolve the specificity factors that would be required to select and import a protein encoded on another organisms genome ? we describe here a model whereby the plant ironbearing protein ferredoxin can be imported across the outer membrane of the plant pathogen pectobacterium by means of a brownian ratchet mechanism , thereby liberating iron into the bacterium to enable its growth in plant tissues . this import pathway is facilitated by fusc , a member of the same protein family as the mitochondrial processing peptidase ( mpp ) . the brownian ratchet depends on binding sites discovered in crystal structures of fusc that engage a linear segment of the plant protein ferredoxin . sequence relationships suggest that the bacterial gene encoding fusc has previously unappreciated homologues in plants and that the protein import mechanism employed by the bacterium is earths carbon cycle depends on saprophytic microbes to rot old or diseased plant matter and recycle carbon from that biomass . some bacteria ( phytopathogens ) have evolved to cause disease and rot in even healthy plants and may have utility as biological control agents against noxious weeds . to understand the mechanisms driving each of these scenarios has significance in environmental engineering and agriculture . access to iron is a limiting factor for bacteria-mediated plant rot . here , we show how a plant-pathogenic bacteria has reevolved a mechanism , analogous to the protein import pathways that evolved in plant plastids and mitochondria , to import the plant ironbearing protein ferredoxin from plant tissue . the study is based on structural and biophysical characterization of a key m16 family protease , fusc , resident inside the bacterial outer membrane . tonb-dependent transporters ( tbdts ) are 22-stranded -barrel proteins integrated in the bacterial outer membrane . they contain a plug domain inserted inside the -barrel that can be actively removed by the inner membrane protein tonb to provide access for the import of vitamins , chelated metals , and other cofactors essential to bacterial viability [ 1 ] . these various cofactors need to be small enough to pass through the internal channel of the tbdt , a channel whose internal diameter is approximately 20 ã [ 13 ] . tbdts also serve as an outer membrane channel to initiate the import of bacteriocins , a class of protein antibiotics that are larger than the channel diameter but that have evolved to unfold in response to engagement with their specific target tbdt [ 4 , 5 ] . the genes for bacteriocins have coevolved with the genes for the tbdts , producing an exquisitely specific and deadly system of protein transport to control bacterial population growth [ 6 ] . fusc__a_plant-type_protease_found_in_pectobacterium species of pectobacterium across the globe are distinguished geographically because they have evolved to specifically rot-endemic plants [ 13 ] . phytopathogens can travel with introduced plant species , and whole genome sequencing of the recently identified australian biocontrol isolate showed genome characteristics of a large group of isolates from china . this is in contradistinction to other pectobacterium isolates from the southern hemisphere ( new zealand , south africa , south america ) , which form a wholly distinct clade ( fig 1a ) . m16 proteases are typically either a dimer of approximately 50-kda two-domain subunits [ 25 ] or an approximately 100-kda monomer composed of four domains [ 26 ] . signalp [ 27 ] predicts that fusc from pectobacterium has a 25-residue n-terminal signal sequence that would direct it into the periplasm and , once processed , would produce a mature protein of approximately 100 kda . recombinant fusc was engineered for expression in the periplasm of escherichia coli , and the purified protein was shown to be a monomer in solution ( s2 fig ) . fusc was crystallized and the structure determined . the structure of the fusc monomer demonstrates conserved features seen in the mpp dimer ( fig 2a ) . the crystal structure demonstrated that fusc has the four characteristic domains of an m16 protease , creating the entire clamshell structure from a single polypeptide ( fig 2a ) . these four domains of an m16 protease fit together through interactions between the -sheet and -helix protruding from the opposing domain , creating half of the clamshell ( fig 2b ) . the first of these domains ( fig 2c , s3 fig ) would correspond to the catalytically active -subunit of mpp [ 28 ] , housing the active site residues with a metal ion coordinated by two histidine residues ( h80 and h84 ) and a glutamic acid ( e165 ) . the second domain has an analogous pocket but does not have residues that could coordinate a metal ion for catalysis in protein import pathways , the concept of a brownian ratchet is invoked to explain a means to energize protein movement across a membrane , particularly when some degree of protein unfolding is involved [ 31 ] . such a mechanism requires that a factor on the trans side of the membrane can clamp onto a short segment of the substrate protein to transform the nondirectional brownian motions of the receptor-bound substrate into a vectorial motion across the membrane [ 32 ] . being in the periplasm , fusc would be located on the trans side of the bacterial outer membrane and so was tested for the characteristics required of a factor mediating a brownian ratchet . phytopathogens can have myriad strategies to dominate their necrotic environments . soft rot of host tissues depends on specific protein-secretion systems to deliver proteins with hydrolytic activity into the tissues , and growth and replication of bacteria in this rot are dependent on access to iron from the rotting tissue [ 33 , 34 ] . under conditions of iron limitation , growth of a model species of pectobacterium was shown to be supported by plant ferredoxin as an iron source [ 35 ] . this has led to the understanding that a pathway for iron acquisition from host proteins is a survival strategy for pectobacterium , and the outer membrane receptor responsible for ferredoxin import into p. atrosepticum isolate scri1043 is the tbdt fusa [ 9 ] . how ferredoxin , a tightly folded protein stabilized by its iron cofactor , could be imported across the bacterial outer membrane into the bacterial periplasm had remained a mystery of cell biology . clans_analysis enterobacteriaceae m16 protein sequences ( dataset s1 ) were obtained from interpro ipr011765 peptidase m16 , n-terminal , and redundancy was minimized using cd-hit with a 0.98 cutoff [ 46 ] . fusc-related plant sequences were initially identified through a blast search using pectobacterium fusc as a query sequence . in order to cover a broad phylogenetic distance , plant m16 protein sequences were manually chosen such as to include species of green algae , moss , and monocotyledon and dicotyledon plants ( s3 table ) . a uniform , representative set of plant species ( i.e. , the same genome projects ) was used for the mpp , spp , plant fusc , and prep sequences . the plant sequences were combined with the enterobacterial m16 sequences , and the sequences were classified by an all-against-all blast , clustered based on pairwise similarities , and visualized with clans with a e-value cut off of 1 ã\\x97 1015 [ 47 ] . the genome of p. carotovorum subsp . cartorvorum waldee rmit1 was sequenced by the wellcome trust sanger institute genome sequencing facility . illumina sequencing libraries ( illumina , san diego , ca , united states of america ) were prepared with a 450-bp insert size and were sequenced ( illumina hiseq2000 ) . the long paired-end reads ( 100 bp ) were assembled [ 48 ] ( https : //github.com/sanger-pathogens/ ) and annotated using prokka [ 49 ] . whole genome sequence data were annotated with prokka ( http : //www.vicbioinformatics.com/software.prokka.shtml ) and yielded the following summary statistics : contigs : 99bases : 4995997tmrna : 1rrna : 4cds : 4461trna : 55repeat_region : 3 . to analyze the phylogenetic relationship of p. carotovorum subsp . cartorvorum waldee rmit1 compared with other related strains , a tree was rendered using itol ( http : //itol.embl.de ) . whole genome sequence data for the other pectobacterium spp . were accessed ( https : //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/genomes/1799 ) via ncbi . ultimately , a total of 37 sequenced genomes were used for constructing the phylogenetic trees . tbdt sequences were collected from uniprot and literature [ 50 , 51 ] , duplicates were removed , and the remaining 87 samples were aligned with t-coffee [ 52 ] to generate the formatted alignment results as input file for hmm training . then , we used hmmer [ 53 ] to train the hmm and employed this model to search against the pectobacterium genome dataset . finally , 23 putative sequences with high confidence were retrieved ( table 1 ) . after comparing them with the original dataset , we found no overlap . we added these putative sequences into the original dataset and trained a new hmm to iteratively search against the pectobacterium genome dataset . no further putative sequences were retrieved in this subsequent search . a dna fragment encoding the fusc open reading frame lacking the signal peptide was amplified to contain ncoi and xhoi restriction sites and cloned into a modified pet20b vector with sequence that would add an n-terminal polyhistidine tag followed by a tev cleavage site to the encoded recombinant protein . the resulting vector was designated petfusc . to express a fusc ( e83a ) mutant , whole plasmid mutagenesis was utilized [ 54 ] . to amplify petfusc incorporating a single base pair change from a to c ( at the codon indicated in bold ) , pcr was used with the overlapping oligonucleotide primers : forwardgtagcgcacatggtcgcacacatggtttttcgtg ; reversecacgaaaaaccatgtgtgcgaccatgtgcgctac . the product from this reaction was digested with dpni for 1 h at 37 â°c and then transformed into e. coli top10 cells . plasmid dna was prepared from these colonies and sequenced to confirm the a to c mutation : the resulting plasmid was designated petfusce83a . both vectors were transformed into e. coli bl21 ( de3 ) c41 for protein expression . protein expression was performed in terrific broth ( 12 g tryptone , 24 g yeast extract , 61.3 g k2hpo4 , 11.55 g kh2po4 , 10 g glycerol ) containing 100 mg.ml1 ampicillin for plasmid selection . bacterial cultures were incubated at 37 â°c until od600 of 1.0 , then protein expression was induced with 0.3 mm iptg , and incubation continued for 14 h at 25 â°c . cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed using a cell disruptor ( emulseflex purified fusc alone or in combination with ferredoxin ( 3:1 molar ratio ferredoxin to fusc ) was screened for crystallization conditions using commercially available screens ( approximately 800 conditions ) . no crystals were obtained for fusc alone ; however , crystals grew in a number of conditions with fusc in combination with ferredoxin . crystals of fusc only grew in both the presence of both ferredoxin and 35 mm edta . the presence of fusc and ferredoxin in the crystals was confirmed by collecting crystals with well solution and melting them in h2o for analysis by sds-page . a 10-kda protein corresponding in size to intact ferredoxin was confirmed to be ferredoxin by mass spectrometry ( fig 4a ) . purified concentrated fusc ( e83a ) and ferredoxin were dialyzed extensively against the same reservoir of itc buffer ( 20 mm hepes , 50 mm nacl [ ph 7.5 ] ) . the concentration of proteins post dialysis was determined using absorbance at 280 nm and bca assay . proteins were then diluted in itc buffer to reaction concentrations of 20 m for fusc ( e83a ) and 200 m ferredoxin . protein concentrations were estimated again , following dilution . all itc experiments were performed using a microcal vp-itc calorimeter . ten l ferredoxin was sequentially titrated into the itc reaction chamber containing fusc ( e83a ) . negative heats of binding were observed , and 27 titrations were performed per reaction , allowing the ferredoxin concentration in the chamber to reach saturation . control reactions were performed , with titration of either buffer into fusc ( e83a ) or ferredoxin into buffer . these reactions yielded no significant heats of dilution . all reactions were repeated 3 times ; binding parameters were calculated from the average of the two best reactions . representative heats of binding from a single reaction are presented . sec-saxs was performed using coflow apparatus at the australian synchrotron [ 59 , 60 ] . purified fusc or fusc ( e83a ) +/ ferredoxin were analyzed at a preinjection concentration of 100 m for fusc and 300 m ferredoxin . chromatography for sec-saxs was performed at 22 â°c with a 10/30 superdex s200 column , at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min in 50 mm tris , 100 mm nacl , 5 % glycerol , and 0.2 % sodium azide [ ph7.9 ] . the inclusion of glycerol and azide were essential to prevent capillary fouling due to photo-oxidation of buffer components . scattering data were collected for 1-s exposures over a q range of 0.0 to 0.3 ã 1 . a buffer blank for each sec-saxs run was prepared by averaging 1020 frames pre- or postprotein elution . scattering curves from peaks corresponding to fusc or fusc ( e83a ) were then buffer subtracted , scaled across the elution peak , and compared for interparticle effects . identical curves ( 510 ) from each elution were then averaged for analysis . data were analyzed using the atsas package , scatter , and somo solution modeler [ 61 ] . sedimentation velocity ( sv ) was carried out in a beckman coulter optima analytical ultracentrifuge using an an-50 ti 8-hole rotor . fusc ( 370 l ) at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 2 mg.ml1 was loaded into a 12-mm path-length centerpiece and centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for approximately 6 h at 20 â°c . scans were collected every 20 s using absorbance optics ( at 230 , 240 , and 280 nm ; a radial range of 5.87.2 cm ; and radial step size of 0.005 cm ) , using a buffer containing 50 mm tris , 200 mm nacl , ph 7.9 . data were analyzed with sedfit , using the continuous c ( s ) distribution model [ 62 ] . sednterp was used to calculate the partial specific volume , the buffer density , and viscosity at 15 â°c and 20 â°c . s1_fig_disparate_acquisition_of_fusc_genes_in_klebsiella_spp klebsiella genome sequences were visualized using figtree v1.4.3 ( http : //tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/ ) . each terminal node , representing a genome , was colored according to the geographical location for the isolate , based on metadata obtained from the ncbi pathogen detection project database via micro-react.org ( https : //microreact.org/project/ncbi-klebsiella ) . the two genomes that carry the gene encoding fusc are highlighted in yellow . klebsiella pneumoniae subsp . rhinoscleromatis sbs3432 was isolated

monoclonal antibodies ( mabs ) specific for ebolavirus glycoprotein ( gp ) can protect experimental animals against infections . most mabs isolated from ebolavirus survivors appeared to target the glycan cap or the stalk region of the viral gp , which is the envelope protein and the only antigen inducing virus-neutralizing antibody response . some of the mabs were demonstrated to be protective in vivo . here , a panel of mabs from four individual survivors of ebolavirus infection that target the glycan cap or stem region were selected for investigation of the mechanisms of their antiviral effect . comparative characterization of the inhibiting effects on multiple steps of viral replication was performed , including attachment , post-attachment , entry , binding at low ph , post-cleavage neutralization of virions , viral trafficking to endosomes , cell-to-cell transmission , viral egress , and inhibition when added early at various time points post-infection . in addition , fc-domain related properties were characterized , including activation and degranulation of nk cells , antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis and glycan content . the two groups of mabs ( glycan cap versus stem ) demonstrated very different profiles of activities suggesting usage of mabs with different epitope specificity could coordinate inhibition of multiple steps of filovirus infection through fab- and fc-mediated mechanisms , and provide a reliable therapeutic approach . recent progress in isolation of mabs from survivors of filovirus infections suggests that the human adaptive immune system is capable of producing strong antibody responses . however , the effects of mabs with different epitope specificity on individual steps of filovirus infection are still unclear . we evaluated a panel of mabs obtained from survivors of natural filovirus infections , specific for the glycan cap or stem region of gp , for their effects on the attachment of viral particles to the cell surface , intracellular traffic of viral particles , proteolytic processing of gp , its interaction with the npc1 receptor , cell-to-cell virus transmission , virus egress from infected cells , activation of natural killer cells and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis through fc-mediated mechanisms . we found that antiviral activity of glycan cap-specific antibodies results from inhibition of attachment , cell-to-cell transmission and inhibition of virion budding . in contrast , the antiviral mechanisms of stem-specific antibodies were found to be inhibition of virus release from endosomal network to the cytoplasm , and also activation of natural killer cells and phagocytosis mediated by monocytes and neutrophils . the data provide new insight into the development of immune protective mechanisms during natural human infection , and have important implications for the treatment of filovirus infections by passively-transferred antibodies and vaccine design . filoviruses are enveloped , filamentous-like viruses with non-segmented rna genome of negative polarity . the ebolavirus genus of the filoviridae family includes five species : ebola ( ebov ) , sudan ( sudv ) , bundibugyo ( bdbv ) , taã¯ forest ( tafv ) and reston ( restv ) viruses . most of these viruses are responsible for highly lethal disease outbreaks , for example the occurrence of 11,323 human fatalities during the 20132016 ebov epidemic in west africa [ 1 , 2 ] . despite intense international collaborative efforts , there is still no licensed therapeutic available against filovirus disease . mper-specific_mabs_effectively_inhibit_viral_entry in previous work , we isolated and characterized multiple mabs from the blood of human survivors of natural bdbv infection [ 20 ] . to study mechanisms of inhibition of filovirus replication by antibodies , we selected a panel of mabs from four donors , with differing virus neutralization properties and affinity to gps of ebov , bdbv and sudv : bdbv52 , bdbv270 , bdbv41 , bdbv289 , bdbv259 , bdbv317 and bdbv223 ( fig 1 ) . identification of epitopes demonstrated that most of the mabs can be grouped into those recognizing two major antigenic sites : those specific for glycan cap and those specific for stem [ 20 , 25 , 26 ] . to investigate the effect of mabs on intracellular steps of virus life cycle , trafficking of mab-treated vlps through the cell organelle network was analyzed by confocal microscopy . bdbv or ebov vlps were mixed with mabs , placed on vero-e6 cell culture monolayers , incubated for 30 or 60 min and immunostained for ebov vlps and for endosomal markers . unexpectedly , bdbv259 and bdbv317 , but not the other mabs , caused accumulation of vlps in late endosomes , as evidenced by gp/rab7 co-localization ( figs 2e , s5 , s6 and s7 ) . however , the effect of bdbv317 was relatively short , as the co-localization disappeared after one hour of incubation ( s5 and s6 figs ) , probably suggesting instability of bdbv317/gp complexes in the acidic ph of endosomes . when treated with bdbv223 , but not the other mabs , vlps were found to be co-localized with the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 ( lamp-1 ) marker of lysosomes as early as 30 min after infection ( figs 2e and s6 ) , which was still observed at 60 min ( s5 and s6 figs ) . as described above , gp is processed by cysteine proteases , cathepsins b and l , resulting in the removal of glycan cap and mld from gp1 subunit followed by interaction of the exposed rbd with the c-loop of npc1 . treatment of ebov gp with the bacterial metalloproteinase thermolysin also results in deletion of the glycan cap and mld , thus mimicking endosomal proteolysis of gp mediated by cathepsins [ 29 , 30 ] . to test if selected mabs interfere with late stages of virus cell entry by interacting with gp after its cleavage , we treated sucrose gradient-purified replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus enveloped with bdbv gp ( vsv/bdbv-gp ) [ 31 ] with thermolysin and compared its neutralization with non-treated virus . as shown in fig 3a , thermolysin treatment of virions resulted in complete proteolysis of gp1 subunit , and slight reduction of the virus titer ( 3.8-fold ) . incubation of intact vsv/bdbv-gp with neutralizing glycan cap-specific antibodies led to a dramatic reduction of virus titers , whereas thermolysin-processed virus was resistant to bdbv270 , bdbv41 and bdbv289 , with no effect shown for the non-neutralizing bdbv52 mab against either virus preparation . in contrast , gp cleavage with thermolysin did not reduce virus sensitivity to gp2-specific bdbv259 , bdbv317 or bdbv223 mabs , suggesting that these mabs interact with the full-sized and processed fusion-active form of gp equally well , and , thus can inhibit multiple steps of virus entry . however , no mab prevented the proteolysis of gp secondary infection of cells by transfer of virions and intermediate products of viral replication ( genome copies , viral proteins or the whole vrnp complexes ) across the cytoplasmic bridges between infected and uninfected cells was shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of hiv [ 32 ] , influenza virus [ 33 , 34 ] and ebov [ 35 ] . such cell-cell contacts can increase the effective viral moi at the sites of transmission , making this route of infection spread 70-fold [ 35 ] to 23 orders of magnitude [ 32 ] more efficient compared to cell-free dissemination . moreover , use of the alternative intercellular gateway for direct access to the cytoplasm of a new host cell allows virus to escape from antibodies targeting initial steps of cell entry and/or virus egress . to analyze the effects of mabs on cell-to-cell transmission , we used a flow cytometry-based approach previously described for hiv studies [ 36 ] . thp-1 monocytes ( donor cells ) infected with ebov/bdbv-gp ( which expresses egfp ) were incubated with mabs for 1 hour , placed at the top of vero-e6 cell culture monolayers ( acceptor cells ) pre-stained with celltrace far red , and incubated for 72 hours . since all mabs but bdbv52 are strong suppressors of viral entry ( fig 2d ) , their constant presence in the cell medium was expected to prevent spread of infection through the medium . indeed , titration of supernatant aliquots harvested from co-cultures of thp-1 upon completion of replication cycle inside the cell , progeny virions release into the extracellular matrix and spread the infection to bystander cells . the budding of marv can be prevented by antibodies even in the absence of virus neutralization detectable in plaque reduction assays , possibly by bivalent cross-linking of newly formed virions to each other and to the viral proteins exposed on the cell membrane [ 37 ] . we therefore analyzed the effect of mabs on virus release from infected vero-e6 cells . since the presence of the neutralizing mabs in the medium would interfere with analysis of released viral particles by plaque assay , we quantitated both live and neutralized virus released from infected cells and present in the medium by quantifying viral genomic rna by droplet digital rt-pcr . the egress of virus was strongly and dose-dependently inhibited by all glycan cap-specific mabs ( fig 3d ) . in contrast , stalk-specific mabs bdbv259 and bdbv317 increased the viral load in the supernatants when provided in low doses . only high doses of these mabs ( 100 g/ml ) strongly reduced release of viral particles , which did not reach , however , the level of inhibition seen for the glycan cap-specific mabs . taken together , these data suggest that retention of produced virions on the cells is a common mechanism of antibodies targeting external , well-exposed domains of the viral envelope proteins involved in an interaction with a cell surface . strikingly , the single tested non-neutralizing bdbv52 mab next , we tested if mabs can suppress virus replication when added at different time points after infection ( figs 3e , s4a and s13 ) . administration of bdbv270 , bdbv289 , bdbv223 or bdbv317 , which belong to different epitope recognition groups , 3 hours prior to or during cell inoculation completely blocked replication of virus . infection inhibition by bdbv41 and bdbv259 was less prominent . in contrast , the two mper-specific mabs bdbv317 and bdbv223 caused the strongest reduction of infected cell numbers when added up to 3 hours after inoculation . when added at 24 hours post-inoculation , none of the mabs tested could prevent virus replication by more than 20 % . addition of bdbv52 at any time point did not change percentages of egfp+ cells ( fig 3e ) , despite the fact that this mab efficiently inhibited virus egress from infected cells ( fig 3d ) . this finding can be explained by direct virus dissemination between cells skipping the step of virion release into the extracellular space , since bdbv52 did not block cell-to-cell transmission of the virus ( fig 3c ) . the results indicate that mper-specific antibodies are important for control viral replication , as they effectively prevent virus replication when added late . glycosylation is one of the most common posttranslational modifications of viral surface proteins . glycosylation of viral proteins may target key epitopes at the surface of virions , masking them from antibody recognition . a decade ago , an unusual post-translational modification , c-mannosylation , was found at the residue trp288 of ebov sgp , which was the first demonstration of this type of glycosylation in a viral protein [ 38 ] . since then , no evidence of any biological significance of sgp c-mannosylation has been reported . bdbv gp possesses the same w288afw291 motif in the glycan cap , which is considered to be the most immunogenic region of filoviral gp [ 3 , 17 ] . we therefore hypothesized that c-mannosylation of bdbv gp can impact antibody virus neutralization ( fig 4 ) . to test this hypothesis , we disabled the mannosylation site in ebov/bdbv-gp by introduction of the mutation w291a ( fig 1 ) . to avoid interference of sgp with neutralization of viruses and to assess the pure effect of spike gp c-mannosylation on their resistance to mabs , we also disabled the expression of sgp by stabilization of gp gene editing site [ 28 ] . bdbv270 mab demonstrated a striking difference between neutralization of w291- and a291-bearing ( c-mann ) mutants . at a concentration 0.8 g/ml , the levels of neutralization of sgp and sgp/w288 c-mann viruses by this mab were 7.2 % and 72.5 % , respectively . neutralization of the two viruses by mper-specific bdbv223 next , we sought to compare protection by glycan cap- and mper-specific antibodies . since bdbv52 , bdbv41 and bdbv259 mabs are bdbv species-specific and do not bind ebov gp [ 20 ] , and no mouse-adapted bdbv exists so far , they were not included in animal studies . we have shown previously that bdbv289 , bdbv223 and bdbv317 mabs protect mice when given as a single 100 g dose the day after challenge with 1,000 pfu of mouse-adapted ebov delivered by the intraperitoneal route [ 20 , 25 ] . here , we extended the study by testing bdbv270 ( s14 fig ) . the in vivo activity of the antibody was similar to that of another glycan cap-specific mab bdbv289 with 80 % protection ( 4 out of 5 mice ) , with similar dynamics of changes in weight and disease score , although the difference in animal survival between bdbv270 and 2d22 mab groups did not reach statistical significance ( p = 0.0644 , mantel-cox test ) . thus , the two mper-specific mabs demonstrated complete protection and two glycan cap-specific mabs demonstrated a high but not absolute protection in our present and previously reported studies [ 20 , 25 ] with the selected dose and regiment of treatment . besides direct blocking of viral entry and/or exit through interaction with virions via fab domains , mabs also provide a second level of defense by cross-linking the viral proteins exposed on the surface of infected cells and fc receptors on multiple immune cells to activate adcc or adcp mechanisms . natural killer ( nk ) cells play a pivotal role in elimination of infected cells by adcc . activation of fcriiia on nk cells causes the release of cytotoxic granules , which causes apoptotic death of target cells , as well as secretion of cytokines ( ifn and tnf ) and chemokines ( mip-1 and mip-1 ) , which correlate with their activation . phagocytosis through engulfment of infected cells represents another important mechanism of rapid clearance of infection , which is mediated by fcr-bearing immune cells including monocytes , macrophages , dendritic cells , neutrophils , and mast cells known as professional phagocytes [ 39 ] . finally , we selected bdbv223 mab , which has the broadest spectrum of inhibitory activities against different steps of viral infection in vitro , to address the physiological relevance of the observed fc-mediated effects for mper mabs ( fig 5 ) . we introduced the l234a/l235a ( lala ) mutation , which impairs binding of antibodies to fcrs [ 5154 ] , into the fc region of the antibody , and compared the efficacy of mutated and non-mutated recombinant mabs in a mouse model of ebov infection ( fig 6 ) . human igg1 and igg3 have been shown previously to interact with mouse fcrs [ 55 ] . human igg1 induces mouse innate immune effector functions at the levels equivalent to that induced by the most functional mouse subclass , igg2a , while human igg3 shows reduced activity with murine cells compared to human igg1 [ 55 ] . thus , it is possible that the human igg3 mabs can not fully leverage the mouse innate immune system to maximize in vivo protective efficacy . we therefore generated the recombinant bdbv223 mabs of igg1 subclass , although the original bdbv223 subclass is igg3 ( fig 1 ) . groups of balb/c mice ( 5 animals per group ) were inoculated with 1,000 pfu of mouse-adapted ebov , strain mayinga , and 24 hours later treated by the intraperitoneal route with 40 or 100 g of wild-type rbdbv223-igg1 or rbdbv223-igg1-lala . at both doses tested , wild-type antibody , but not the lala mutant , provided the unprecedented epidemic of ebov in west africa in 20132016 demonstrated the urgent need for treatments against this and related highly pathogenic filoviruses . antibody-based therapy remains the only available effective strategy against the infection . further progress in development of more broad and effective filovirus mabs requires identification of the mechanism of the protective effect of these mabs . viruses wild-type bdbv , strain 200706291 uganda , which was originally isolated from the serum of a patient during the first known outbreak [ 69 ] was passaged three times in vero-e6 cells . the ebov/bdbv-gp virus enveloped with glycoprotein of bundibugyo strain , and ebov/bdbv-gpsgp virus lacking sgp production were generated as described earlier [ 28 ] . to generate an ebov/bdbv-gp derivative not expressing egfp , the full-length clone was digested with bsiwi restriction endonuclease to remove egfp gene , and then re-ligated . the resulting plasmid was transfected into 293t cell monolayers to rescue ebov/bdbv-gp_no egfp virus . to obtain ebov/bdbv-gp sgp derivative with disabled c-mannosylation site , we subjected pebowtbamhi-sbfi , asci-pspomi subclone with the orf for the gp of bdbv with stabilized rna editing site to pcr mutagenesis using the quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit ( stratagene ) . amino acid substitution w291a in bdbv gp was introduced into the construct to disrupt c-mannosylation of w288 residue in w288afw291 motif . for generation of full-length construct , apai-saci restriction endonuclease fragment from the resulting subclone was used to replace those in pebo-egfp plasmid . the obtained construct was transfected into 293t cell monolayers to rescue chimeric virus with disrupted c-mannosylation site - ebov/bdbv-gp sgp/w288 c-mann . neutralization of viruses by mabs was tested in high-throughput screening assay based on the detection of residual egfp fluorescence [ 28 ] . to generate vlps enveloped with bdbv gp , glycoprotein orf in pwrg7077:64755-2010-233-1_gp_optgp was substituted with that of bdbv . first , bamhi restriction endonuclease sites were disabled in pebowtbamhi-sbfi , asci-pspomi subclone with the orf for the gp of bdbv with stabilized rna editing site ( sgp ) by introduction of silent mutations using the quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit ( stratagene , la jolla , ca ) . then , bdbv gp orf was amplified from the resulting construct with following primers : direct , agtcacgtgcggccgccaccatggttacatcaggaattct ; and reverse , agtcacgtggatccttatcatcagagtagaaatttgcaaa ( the noti or bamhi restriction endonuclease sites are underlined , and the start of the bdbv gp orf direct sequence and the end of the bdbv gp orf complementary sequence are italicized ) . the obtained pcr product was used to replace ebov gp orf in ebov vlp gp plasmid by noti and bamhi sites to get the final gp-bearing plasmid for bdbv vlp production . ebov np and codon optimized vp40 were cloned into the pcez vector [ 70 ] . pcez-np was a kind gift from drs . kawaoka and feldmann . the plasmids were transfected to 293t cells using transit-lt1 transfection reagent ( mirus ) . vlps were harvested after 72 hours of the transfection , purified by sucrose gradient and quantified using virocyt virus counter ( vc ) 2100 ( virocyt ) . for confocal microscopy , vero-e6 cell cultures ( american type culture collection ) were grown in monolayers in chambered slides . bdbv vlps were incubated in the presence of mabs ( 200 g/ml ) for 1 hour at room temperature , added to vero-e6 cell culture monolayers at a ratio of 500 vlp/cell , and cells were placed on ice for 1 hour . then , cells were fixed in formalin ( thermofisher scientific ) for 15 min , permeabilized with 0.5 % triton x-100 in phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ) for 15 min to increase sensitivity of the subsequent immunostaining of viral proteins . cells then were blocked with 5 % donkey serum diluted in pbs with 1 % bsa and 0.1 % triton x-100 ( pbs-t-bsa ) for 1 hour . next , vlps were stained using rabbit immune serum raised against ebov vlps ( ibt bioservices ) supplemented with rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for bdbv gp ( ibt bioservices ; all antibodies for virus staining were diluted at 1:100 in pbs-t-bsa ) . the slides then were incubated with donkey anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with alexafluor 647 ( thermofisher scientific ) for 1 hour at room temperature . next , the slides were washed 3 times in pbs with 0.1 % triton x-100 ( pbs-t ) , fixed in 10 % formalin and incubated with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride ( dapi ) ( invitrogen ) at 1 g/ml for 2 min . then , slides were washed 5 times in pbs and mounted onto coverslips bdbv was adsorbed on vero-e6 monolayer cell cultures in 24-well plates at an moi of 0.1 pfu/cell for 20 min at 4âºc . cells were washed 3 times with cold pbs , incubated with four-fold serial dilutions of mabs for 20 min at 4âºc , washed again and covered with a 0.45 % methylcellulose overlay in minimal essential medium ( mem ) with 2 % fetal bovine serum . cells were incubated for 6 days at 37âºc , and plaques were visualized by immunostaining with bdbv52 mab [ 20 ] followed by secondary goat anti-human igg conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and 4cn two-component peroxidase substrate system ( kpl ) . post-attachment inhibition was calculated as a percent reduction of numbers of viral plaques developed after incubation with antibody compared to no mab control , as previously described [ 71 , 72 ] . for the no-mab control samples , the average number of plaques per well was 263 . three million pfu of egfp-expressing ebov/bdbv-gp were incubated with various mabs at the final concentration 100 g/ml for 1 hour at 37âºc and then adsorbed on vero-e6 cell culture monolayers for 40 min at 4âºc . cells were washed 3 times with mem containing 10 % fbs and incubated in fresh medium for 24 hours . then , cells were treated with trypsin , harvested , washed twice with pbs and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 24 hours for virus inactivation . cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using an accuri c6 cytometer ( bd biosciences ) to determine the percentages of infected egfp+ cells and their mean fluorescence intensity ( mfi ) . on average , 7,728 events were acquired per sample . bdbv vlps were generated as described above . ebov vlps were purchased from ibt bioservices . bdbv or ebov vlps were incubated with 200 g/ml of mabs for 60 min at 37âºc . monolayers of vero-e6 cells were inoculated with vlp/mab complexes , incubated for 30 or 60 min and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min . monolayers were washed and permeabilized with 0.5 % triton-x100 solution in pbs for 15 min . monolayers were blocked with 5 % donkey serum diluted in pbs-t-bsa for 30 min . cell monolayers were stained with mouse mab specific for lysosomal marker lamp-1 ( santa cruz ) at a 1:50 dilution and goat polyclonal antibodies specific for late endosome marker rab7 ( santa cruz ) at a 1:50 dilution . vlps were stained with rabbit immune serum against ebov vlps or the same rabbit immune serum supplemented with rabbit anti-bdbv gp polyclonal antibody ( ibt bioservices ) at a 1:100 dilution for each antibody . slides were incubated for 1 hour at 37âºc , washed 3 times as above , and incubated with a mixture of three secondary antibodies , each at 1:200 dilution in pbs-t-bsa : donkey anti-mouse conjugated with alexa fluor 488 , donkey anti-goat conjugated with alexa fluor 594 and donkey anti-rabbit conjugated with alexafluor 647 ( thermofisher scientific ) . next , cells were washed 3 times in pbs-t , and nuclei were stained with dapi , as described above . slides were analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy using an olympus fv1000 vsv/bdbv-gp was propagated in vero-e6 cells ; at 48 hours after inoculation , the virus suspension was harvested and clarified from cell debris by low-speed centrifugation . to purify the virus , supernatants were placed atop a 25 % sucrose cushion and pelleted in an ultracentrifuge for 2 hours at 175,000 x g , 4âºc . pellets were resuspended in 1x ste buffer ( 10 mm tris , 1 mm edta , 0.1 m nacl ) and further purified by ultracentrifugation in 2060 % sucrose gradient ( 1.5 hours at 288,000 x g , 4âºc ) . the virus-containing band was harvested , and vsv/bdbv-gp virions were washed from sucrose by final ultracentrifugation in 1x ste buffer ( 1 hour , 4âºc , 175,000 x g ) . the obtained viral particles were resuspended in 1x ste buffer . flat-bottom high-binding 96-well microplates ( greiner bio-one ) were coated overnight with purified vsv/bdbv-gp particles diluted in pbs . bound antigen was blocked with 1 % bovine serum albumin ( sigma-aldrich ) in pbst buffer ( 0.1 % tween-20 in pbs ) , and treated for 20 min with 20 mm sodium citrate , ph 5.0 ( sigma-aldrich ) , or pbs for 20 min . mabs were added at 1 g/ml in 0.1 % tween-20 containing 20 mm sodium citrate , ph 5.0 , or pbst buffer ,

described above was resuspended in thermolysin digestion buffer ( 50 mm tris , ph 8.0 , 0.5 mm cacl2 ) and divided into two aliquots ; one aliquot was treated with 0.5 mg/ml of thermolysin ( promega ) and another one with an equal volume of thermolysin digestion buffer ( mock-treated virus ) for 40 min at 37âºc . the reactions were stopped by addition of edta up to the final concentration 10 mm . virus samples were re-pelleted through a 25 % sucrose cushion as described above , and washed by ultracentrifugation in 10 mm tris , 0.1 m nacl for 1 hour at 175,000 x g , 4âºc . the resulting preparations were resuspended in 10 mm tris , 0.1 m nacl , incubated with 100 g/ml mabs for 1 hour at 37âºc , or mock-incubated , and titrated on triplicate vero-e6 cell culture monolayers using plaque reduction assay . aliquots of thermolysin-treated or mock-treated purified virions were heated for 10 min at 95âºc and separated in nu-page 4 to 12 % bis-tris gel with novex sharp pre-stained protein standard used as a molecular weight marker . proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using the iblot gel transfer system ( life technologies ) . the membrane was incubated with primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies against bdbv gp ( 1:500 ; ibt bioservices ) and secondary goat anti-rabbit igg antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase ( 1:500 ; kpl ) . protein bands were visualized using the chromogenic 4cn two-component peroxidase substrate system ( kpl ) . ebov vlps alone or in the presence of 200 g/ml of mabs were incubated in sodium acetate buffer , ph 5.0 , with 0.1 g/l of cathepsin b and cathepsin l at 37âºc overnight . thereafter , vlps were denatured in laemmli buffer ( novex ) in reducing conditions , and gp cleavage was confirmed by immunoblotting with a pan-filovirus gp-specific monoclonal antibody ( ibt bioservices ) . densitometry was performed using imagej gel analyzer plug-in . for normalization , we used vp40 as a housekeeping protein and the 20 kda band of gp as the target protein . thp-1 monocytic cells ( american type culture collection ) were inoculated with ebov/bdbv-gp virus expressing egfp at moi of 2 pfu/cell , incubated for 48 hours , washed two times to remove unbound virus , and incubated with 100 g/ml of mabs or no mab . following a one hour-long incubation , cells were placed atop of monolayers of vero-e6 cells pre-stained with celltrace far red ( thermofisher scientific ) according to the manufacturers recommendations , incubated for 72 hours and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde . cells were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the percentages of cells double-positive for celltrace far red and egfp of total cells positive for celltrace far red . the percentage of double-positive cells indicated the percentage of cells that became infected due to cell-to-cell transmission of virus . for each sample , 30,000 events were counted . in a separate experiment , supernatant aliquots were harvested from co-cultures of thp-1 and vero-e6 cells on days 35 after the inoculation of monocytes and then titrated on vero-e6 cell monolayers . vero-e6 cell culture monolayers were inoculated with ebov/bdbv-gp

considered a rural disease , but there is growing evidence of a peri-urban and urban transmission in several countries , including cambodia . we , therefore , compared the epidemiologic dynamic of japanese encephalitis between a rural and a peri-urban setting in cambodia . we monitored two cohorts of 15 pigs and determined the force of infectionrate at which seronegative pigs become positivein two study farms located in a peri-urban and rural area , respectively . we also studied the mosquito abundance and diversity in proximity of the pigs , as well as the host densities in both areas . all the pigs seroconverted before the age of 6 months . the force of infection was 0.061 per day ( 95 % confidence interval = 0.0340.098 ) in the peri-urban cohort and 0.069 per day ( 95 % confidence interval = 0.0470.099 ) in the rural cohort . several differences in the epidemiologic dynamic of japanese encephalitis between both study sites were highlighted . the later virus amplification in the rural cohort may be linked to the later waning of maternal antibodies , but also to the higher pig density in direct proximity of the studied pigs , which could have led to a dilution of mosquito bites at the farm level . the force of infection was almost identical in both the peri-urban and the rural farms studied , which shifts the classic epidemiologic cycle of the virus . this study is a first step in improving our understanding of japanese the number of japanese encephalitis cases has decreased substantially over the past decades with the implementation of childhood vaccination programs . japanese encephalitis virus , however , remains the most important cause of acute viral encephalitis in eastern and southern asia , with an estimated 68,000 cases reported annually worldwide . our results demonstrate that japanese encephalitis virus circulates intensely both in a rural and a peri-urban setting in cambodia , which raises important public health concerns as peri-urban areas are densely populated . these results support the importance of changing vaccination recommendations for travelers and of not focusing national immunization programs against japanese encephalitis solely on rural areas . even though the number of cases has decreased substantially over the past decades with the implementation of childhood vaccination programs in many asian countries , japanese encephalitis virus ( jev ) remains the most important cause of acute encephalitis in eastern and southern asia [ 1,2 ] . according to the latest world health organization estimates , approximately 68,000 cases are notified annually , of which 15,000 die . most of these cases occur in children under 15 years of age [ 1 ] . these figures are , however , probably underestimated [ 2 ] . in cambodia , the annual incidence in this age group was estimated in 2008 at 11.1 cases per 100,000 , based on sentinel hospital surveillance data from 2006 to 2008 [ 3 ] . furthermore , the geographic range of jev keeps expanding and now extends from the south of russia to northern australia including japan , eastern china , india and south-east asia [ 4 ] . ethics_statement all research was carried out under an animal care permit from the national animal health and production research institute ( nahpri , former national veterinary research institutenavri ) . we observed the animal welfare principles of the world organization for animal healths ( oie ) terrestrial animal health code , chapter 7.8 use of animals in research and education [ 24 ] . we sampled the animals every eight to 11 days to limit handling and sampling stress . in the peri-urban farm , where animals were not born onsite , we did not sample the pigs during the first two weeks following their arrival in order to give them time to acclimatize to their new environment . this study was conducted in two farms , located in a peri-urban and a rural area , respectively . fifteen pigs were raised and followed in each farm . the peri-urban farm was located in ta khmau , kandal province , in the southern suburbs of phnom penh , in an area characterized both by a high human density and a mix of urban and rural landscape with cultivated fields ( fig 1 ) . pigs in the peri-urban farm were ear-tagged c01 to c15 , and those in the rural farm d01 to d15 . every eight to 11 days , we sampled blood from each pig at the jugular vein using dry tubes with a vacuette system . in pigs , immunoglobulins m ( igm ) against jev generally appear two to three days post-infection , peak at around one week , and persist approximately two to three weeks [ 27 ] , whereas igg develop within several weeks [ 28 ] . their viremia usually remains sufficiently high to infect mosquitoes during two to four days [ 28,29 ] . in this study , igg antibodies were detected in the pig sera using an indirect elisa test adapted from yang et al . and described in details in duong et al . [ 26,30 ] . the optical density ( od ) was measured for each sample and the mean od value m of the three negative controls run on each microplate was used to define the cut-off values . a sample was considered positive if its od was higher than four times m , negative if its od was lower than three times m , and equivocal if its od was between three and four times m . one home-made cdc light-trap was placed next to the pig pens during three consecutive nights every month during the entire duration of the study , from july to october 2015 . mosquitoes captured were counted and species were identified using southeast asia morphological identification keys [ 3537 ] . household surveys were conducted within a one-km radius around each farm using standardized questionnaires designed for this study ( s1 file ) to estimate the human densities and that of different domestic animals . a circle of one km in radius was drawn on google earth around each farm and divided into four equal areas . to approximate the demographic weight of each of these four quadrants , we counted the number of houses and subsequently respected the proportion of households they represented in the study area when we defined the number of households to interview per quadrant . we walked along the roads identified using google earth and selected households to be interviewed based on residents presence at the time of our visit , until we reached the desired number of interviews for each quadrant . households surveyed were , therefore , not selected randomly , but were to the best of our ability distributed homogeneously across each study area . we calculated human densities using the results from the questionnaires , the surface of the delimited area and the number of houses originally counted . we then estimated domestic animal densities using the ratios of each animal species per inhabitant and the computed human densities . we used the same method as cappelle et al . to estimate the force of infection in this study [ 20 ] . the force of infection is the rate at which sero-negative pigs become positive , also defined as the instantaneous probability of a susceptible pig to become infectious . it can be expressed by : pig_monitoring all 29 pigs that remained at the end of the study seroconverted by the age of six months . serology and virology results of the peri-urban ( ta khmau ) and rural ( kandal ) cohorts are detailed in tables 1 and 2 , respectively , as well as in the s1 and s2 figs . since immunity against je is long-lasting in pigs , sampling was stopped before the age of six months in ta khmau ( table 1 ) because all the pigs had two consecutive positive samples . pigs were , however , kept on the farm until the end of october so that mosquito captures could be done in a similar environment . detailed counts of mosquitoes per species , farm , and month can be found in the s2a , s2b , s2c and s2d table . the number of mosquitoes captured during two successive nights varied greatly in both sites ( fig 2 ) . slightly more mosquitoes were consistently captured in the peri-urban farm ( ta khmau ) between july and september , and this difference was greater than six-fold in october . in ta khmau , the number of mosquitoes captured increased from july to october , whereas in kandal , it increased from july to september , but decreased in october . approximately 2,365 households were counted within one km around the peri-urban farm and 530 were similarly counted around the rural farm . we interviewed 280 ( 11.8 % ) and 138 ( 26.0 % ) households in ta khmau and kandal , respectively . the mean number of persons per household was estimated using the results from the interviews , and was 5.8 ( sd = 2.6 ) in ta khmau and 5.1 ( sd = 2.2 ) in kandal . the population density was then calculated in both areas , at 4,363 inhabitants/km2 in the peri-urban site and at 857 inhabitants/km2 in the rural site . july 10th 2015 ( date of the third blood sample ) was the starting date for the calculation of the force of infection in the peri-urban cohort , with seven susceptible pigs . the estimated force of infection was 0.061 per day ( 95 % confidence interval ( ci 95 % ) = 0.0340.098 ) ; during that period , a susceptible pig had a 6.1 % probability of getting infected by jev every day ( fig 4 ) . august 31rst 2015 ( date of the 8th blood sample ) was the starting date for the calculation of the force of infection in the rural cohort , with 12 susceptible pigs . the estimated force of infection was 0.069 per day ( ci 95 % = 0.0470.099 ) : during that period , a susceptible pig had a probability of 6.9 % of being infected by jev every day ( fig 5 ) . all pigs in both study farms seroconverted before the age of six months . these results confirm those of duong et al . and those of cappelle et al . showing that jev circulates intensely in rural , but also in peri-urban settings in cambodia [ 20,26 ] . they also complement the studies carried out by lindahl et al. , which evidenced the circulation of jev in an urban environment in southern vietnam for the first time [ 17,18 ] . our results show that jev circulates intensely both in a peri-urban and a rural setting in cambodia , with a force of infection almost identical in both the peri-urban and the rural farms studied . this absence of difference shifts the classic epidemiologic cycle of the virus and this study is a first step in improving our understanding of jev ecology in different environments with distinct landscapes , human , and animal densities . this knowledge can be important for the implementation of vaccination campaigns and guidance for travelers . for example , vaccination against je is currently only recommended for travelers to cambodia who are staying in urban areas for a long period of time or in rural areas for short stays . however , our results show that travelers visiting urban areas at all should also be advised to be vaccinated against je . measuring parameters such as the force of infection is also very important to calibrate mathematical models that can be used to better understand the complexity of vector-borne diseases in general and to theoretically test the impact of different control plans and their possible combinations . this is particularly important in countries like cambodia , where the continuity of the je vaccination program is not yet ensured . finally , the protocol we developed to monitor jev , a virus that is particularly difficult to isolate , was very successful in detecting jev among pigs . it could be easily applied in other areas of cambodia and neighboring countries to improve s1_file_questionnaire_used_for_the_household_surveys https : //doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0006644.s001 the optic density of each sample was divided by 3 times the mean absorbance of the three negative controls in the corresponding elisa plate and then their average was calculated for each sampling date and type of igg kinetic . the blue line corresponds to the negativity threshold , the red curve to the pigs with an increasing igg antibody kinetic ( c01 , c02 , c03 , c05 , and c12 ) , and the green curve to the pigs with a u-shaped igg antibody kinetic ( all other pigs ) . the optic density of each sample was divided by 3 times the mean absorbance of the three negative controls in the corresponding elisa plate and then their average was calculated for each sampling date and type of igg kinetic . the blue line corresponds to the negativity threshold , the red curve to the pigs with an increasing igg antibody kinetic ( d06 only ) , and the green curve to the pigs with a u-shaped igg antibody kinetic ( all other pigs ) . adapted from duong et al .

south america . resistance takes noticeably longer to appear in the high-transmission settings of sub-saharan africa , although it may spread rapidly thereafter . here , we test the hypothesis that competitive suppression of drug-resistant parasites by drug-sensitive parasites may inhibit evolution of resistance in high-transmission settings , where mixed-strain infections are common . we employ a cross-scale model , which simulates within-host ( infection ) dynamics and between-host ( transmission ) dynamics of sensitive and resistant parasites for a population of humans and mosquitoes . using this model , we examine the effects of transmission intensity , selection pressure , fitness costs of resistance , and cross-reactivity between strains on the establishment and spread of resistant parasites . we find that resistant parasites , introduced into the population at a low frequency , are more likely to go extinct in high-transmission settings , where drug-sensitive competitors and high levels of acquired immunity reduce the absolute fitness of the resistant parasites . under strong selection from antimalarial drug use , however , resistance spreads faster in high-transmission settings than low-transmission ones . these contrasting results highlight the distinction between establishment and spread of resistance and suggest that the former but not the latter may be inhibited in high-transmission settings . our results suggest that within-host competition is a key factor shaping the evolution of drug resistance in p. falciparum . the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum has evolved resistance to most antimalarial drugs , greatly complicating treatment and control of the disease . curiously , although sub-saharan africa accounts for the majority of the global burden of malaria , the evolution of drug resistance in africa has been markedly delayed compared to asia and the americas . one reason might be that , in a population in which the prevalence of infection is high , a newly emerged drug-resistant strain faces a high risk of extinction due to competition from drug-sensitive parasites that already occupy most of the host population . using a mathematical model , we confirm that drug-resistant parasites face a much greater risk of extinction in a high-transmission setting like sub-saharan africa than in a low-transmission setting like southeast asia . however , we also find that when drug-resistant parasites manage to avoid extinction , their subsequent spread may be more rapid in high-transmission settings than in low-transmission settings , especially when selection is strong . these results offer a novel explanation for global patterns of drug resistance evolution in malaria and suggest a new dimension to consider in resistance prevention and containment efforts : namely , the intrinsic favorability of low- and high-transmission settings for establishment and spread of drug resistance . drug resistance is a recurring threat to effective treatment and control of p. falciparum malaria . chloroquinea highly effective synthetic antimalarialwas used to combat malaria on a massive scale in the 1950s ; by the 1960s , resistance to chloroquine had developed in southeast asia and south america , and over the next few decades , chloroquine resistance spread to virtually every corner of the malaria-endemic world [ 1 ] . sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine , the prevailing substitute for chloroquine , was also rapidly undermined by resistance [ 1 ] . artemisinin-based combination therapies ( acts ) , which are now the standard treatment for p. falciparum malaria in most countries , are in danger of widespread failure , with resistance to artemisinin and piperaquine entrenched and spreading in southeast asia despite focused containment efforts [ 2 ] . at present , acts are the last broadly effective antimalarial drugs left ; the prospect of widespread resistance therefore represents a looming crisis in global health . we developed a nested individual-based model consisting of a population of human hosts for which the within-host dynamics of parasites , red blood cells ( rbcs ) , and immune responses are modeled using a set of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) . the parasite population is assumed to comprise an effectively infinite variety of strains , which are phenotypically classified as either sensitive or resistant , and the dynamics of these two types are explicitly described in the model . ( we effectively assume that there are multiple strains of each type in the population but only a single strain of each type within a given host . ) transmission between human hosts and a mosquito population is simulated using stochastic sampling algorithms ; the frequency of humanmosquito contact is used as a proxy for transmission intensity . the within-host model accurately mimics the dynamics of parasites and immune responses observed in p. falciparum infections . fig 2 shows the simulated within-host dynamics of infection with a single strain , in the absence of preexisting immunity or antimalarial drugs . the dynamics of infected rbcs ( fig 2a ) are qualitatively similar to those observed in malaria-therapy patients ( examples shown in [ 30,31 ] ) , which are still one of the best sources of data on malaria infection dynamics in naã¯ve hosts . gametocyte density ( fig 2b ) , innate immunity ( fig 2c ) , and acquired immunity ( fig 2d ) all more or less track the dynamics of infected rbcs . note that gametocytes persist several weeks longer than asexual parasites , consistent with observations from human malaria infections [ 32 ] . acquired immunity fluctuates ( a result of the way antigenic variation is built into the model ) but eventually stabilizes at a high level that serves to reduce parasite growth in future infections . the full nested model produces epidemiological patterns that are consistent with empirical observations . first , we show how the mosquito biting ratethe parameter that determines transmission intensity in our simulationsdetermines the entomological inoculation rate ( eir ; the number of infective mosquito bites per person per year ) . eir was estimated for simulations with four different values of b ( mean number of mosquito bites per person per day ) . for simulations with b = 5 , b = 10 , b = 15 , and b = 20 , respectively , the estimated eirs are 6.1 , 25.3 , 47.9 , and 72.6 infective bites per person per year . these values are not fixed , since eir depends on the total prevalence of infection in the human population , which can vary both within and between simulations ( for instance , an intervention can reduce the prevalence of infection and consequently decrease eir , even if the mosquito biting rate remains the same ) . the exact values are less important than the fact that for a two-fold change in biting rate , eir more than doubles , reflecting the fact that mosquito biting rate affects not only the frequency of contact between humans and mosquitoes but also the likelihood that any particular mosquito is infective , since the prevalence of infection among humans increases with transmission intensity as well . this finding is consistent with a well-known feature of the ross-macdonald model , in which r0 is proportional to a2 in order to understand how within-host competition affects the spread of resistant parasites at the population level , it is helpful to first examine what happens in the absence of selection . we ran simulations lasting 8,000 days ( 21.9 years ) , with sensitive parasites introduced at the start and resistant parasites introduced after 3,000 days ( 8.2 years ) . resistant parasites were randomly introduced into 2 % of human hosts , with no antimalarial drug use and no fitness cost of resistance . we ran sets of 10 independent simulations for four conditions : low transmission ( b = 5 ) and high transmission ( b = 15 ) with high cross-reactivity and low cross-reactivity between strains . as discussed above , greater cross-reactivity tends to intensify competition between strains . one of the most compelling pieces of evidence that within-host competition could inhibit the evolution of resistance comes from the results of simulations with no selection at all , in which the only forces at work are ecological ones . simulations with no antimalarial drug use and no intrinsic fitness differences between sensitive and resistant parasites show that resistant parasites introduced at low frequency persist longer in a low-transmission setting than in a high-transmission setting with otherwise identical parameters . analysis of the within-host dynamics in these simulations shows that , in a high-transmission setting , the newly introduced resistant parasites almost always finds themselves in mixed-strain infections , in which they suffer from competition with drug-sensitive parasites . as the newcomers in these mixed infections , the resistant parasites suffer disproportionately from within-host competition , even though they are not intrinsically less fit ; this effect of prior residency has been observed in the p. chabaudi model system [ 19 ] . in contrast , in low-transmission settings , the newly introduced resistant parasites are more likely to find unoccupied territory in hosts without drug-sensitive competitors . as a result , the resistant parasites suffer less from within-host competition and are better able to persist in the population . since the majority of p. falciparum infections are probably untreated at any given time [ 16 ] , being able to persist in the population long enough to experience episodes of positive selection by antimalarial drugs is likely to be a key determinant of the evolution we use a nested model of parasite population dynamics : a model of within-host dynamics embedded into another model that simulates parasite transmission between humans and mosquitoes . essentially , the model tracks a population of humans , a population of mosquitoes , and the parasites that circulate among them . infections in mosquitoes are tracked over time , while the dynamics of infection in each human host are modeled using odes . the model simulates within-host dynamics in 24-hour increments interspersed with daily transmission of parasites between humans and mosquitoes ; any new parasites that are introduced to a human host are incorporated into the population of parasites tracked by the within-host model . the general structure of the full model is illustrated in fig 11 . the within-host model consists of a system of odes that describe the dynamics of infection for two parasite types ( sensitive and resistant , denoted with subscripts 1 and 2 , respectively ) . the dynamics of the following components are described : unlike the within-host model , which is governed by deterministic equations , the between-host model is stochastic ; as a result , multiple simulations with the same parameters and starting conditions will tend to yield similar but not identical resultsunless the conditions favor highly divergent trajectories , such as scenarios that tip either toward extinction or toward epidemic spread . an aspect of the model with particularly broad ramifications is the diversity of the parasite population , particularly as it pertains to recognition by the adaptive immune system . in the simulations presented here , we assume a complete lack of population structure : all strains in the population , whether sensitive or resistant , are equally related . ( however , we note that the design of the within-host model results in competition between sensitive and resistant strains being slightly weaker than competition between strains of the same type , particularly in hosts that have had only a few infections . this permits stable coexistence between the strains in settings in which transmission and cross-reactivity between different strains are both lowwhich is not unreasonable , since some degree of linkage between resistance mutations and antigenic loci is to be expected , particularly in low-transmission settings in which recombination rates are low ) [ 52 ] . in the simulations presented here , antimalarial drug treatment is conditional only on the host being infected with parasites ( above the extinction threshold , a total infected rbc density greater than 104 ) . if a host is infected ( and not already being treated ) , there is a fixed daily probability of beginning antimalarial treatment . if started , drug treatment is maintained for a fixed duration of 14 days , regardless of whether parasite clearance is achieved . simulated populations consisted of 400 human hosts and 12,000 mosquitoes ; transmission intensity was determined by the rate of contact between humans and mosquitoes rather than the ratio of mosquitoes to humans . simulations were run for a total duration of 8,000 days . age was uniformly distributed with a maximum of 3,000 days ; when hosts reached this limit , they were removed and replaced with naã¯ve hosts of age zero . drug-sensitive parasites were introduced at an initial prevalence of 10 % , and the simulation was run for 3,000 days to allow the system to reach equilibrium before introducing drug-resistant parasites at a prevalence of 2 % . use of antimalarial drugs , when included , was initiated at the start of each simulation . s1_text_details_of_the_mathematical_model__including_parameter_values https : //doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2005712.s001 panels aq vary in treatment rate ( daily probability of infected host starting treatment ) and fitness cost ( proportional reduction in within-host growth rate for the resistant type ) . each four-part panel presents results for ( i ) low transmission/high cross-reactivity , ( ii ) high transmission/high cross-reactivity , ( iii ) low transmission/low cross-reactivity , and ( iv ) high transmission/low cross-reactivity . for all figures , solid lines and shaded areas show mean and range of 3 independent simulations , respectively .
